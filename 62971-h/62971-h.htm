<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>“Doctor Lynn, you are in the incipient
stage of tuberculosis. You should return to
California immediately.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That is what Dr. Graves said to me to-day and
he is in a position to know what he is talking about.
But I can’t believe it! Why, I can do the work of
two women. Haven’t I supported myself since I was
fifteen years old, worked my way through Medical
College and built up a city practice by my own,
unaided efforts? Besides, every one says I am the
picture of health. My five feet eight of energised
muscle, my high colour, my breadth of shoulder, all
seem to give such a diagnosis the lie.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet a still voice whispers in my heart, “It is
true.” Since that last severe attack of grippe the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>buoyancy has vanished from my step. Life has become
a drag.</p>

<p class='c007'>But then, why not? The last two years have
been strenuous. Just two years ago to-day San
Francisco went down in earthquake and flames, scattering
my growing practice to the winds. And of
course Dan’s position went too. But we celebrated
with an earthquake wedding, and it was not long
until my husband had worked out his great invention,
and we came here; he to gain financial backing
for his project, and I to profit by the abundance of
clinical material in a great city.</p>

<p class='c007'>And then the panic of 1907 struck us. Why, the
earthquake was nothing to that. Poor Dan was
crushed. How can I tell him of this new calamity?
And what will it profit to add to his burden, helpless
as he is? For months now, he has walked the streets
looking for any kind of employment at any wage,
but none is to be had. This hopeless seeking, added
to the stunning blow of the collapse of his company
and the deadening pressure of debt incurred last fall
when we borrowed to the utmost limit of all our
friends’ capacity in a frantic endeavour to save the
invention, only to lose money, company, invention—all
in one universal crash—has completely unnerved
him. To see his wife forced into the depths through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>his failure, even though that failure was no fault of
his, has been gall and wormwood to him. Those
days when we pledged every pawnable article in a
dogged desire to hang on for just one week longer in
the hope that the tide would turn; when we moved
from lodgings to lodgings, each meaner and more
squalid than the last, until the fathomless pit of
hell itself seemed reached in this slum; when I gave
up my work in the college where the wonderful experience
gained was ample compensation except to
those driven by grim necessity to seek for any work
that would keep this vile tenement over our heads
and put food in our mouths;—all these things have
left him a broken-hearted man.</p>

<p class='c007'>And there are many such. Months of idleness, a
diet of bread and coffee, all the horrors of shivering
nights in the open or in vermin-infested flop houses,
the morning rush for the “help wanted” pages of the
daily papers, the standing in line for hours waiting
to apply for a job—a hundred men for a single position—would
these things not take the heart, nay,
the very soul itself, out of a man?</p>

<p class='c007'>When I was discharged last month, losing my
position because of a general retrenchment, never
shall I forget the scenes at the Public Library when
with scores of others I sought the protection of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>sheltering walls at early morning to thaw the night’s
coldness out of my half-frozen body, and search
the papers for a possible chance of employment.</p>

<p class='c007'>One young man in the huddled group interested
me immensely. When the doors swung open, he
bounded up the stairs like an athlete, well in the lead
of the rushing horde who refused to wait for the
elevator in their frenzied scramble for the first
chance at a paper and possible employment. Well-dressed,
palpably clean living and efficient, he was
an excellent type of the successful young business
man. I could picture him as a broker, in an insurance
office or bank, or filling some responsible position
in a business house. But in the fall of many
such houses, his had evidently gone down to ruin
and now the lad was beginning to feel the pinch
that comes from weeks of idleness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning after morning he appeared. His well-tailored
suit gave way to a misfit piece of shoddy;
his hat was replaced by a cap which failed to conceal
his need of a hair-cut; his face became lean
and haggard; no longer was his expression one of
energy and confidence. A three days’ growth of
beard on his jowls will take some of the confidence
out of any man when looking for employment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then for days he disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Came a day when I saw him. It was blizzard
weather; a sleety rain was carried on a high wind
which swept through the city streets and wailed and
whistled round the entrance to the Library building.
A gaunt figure dragged its feeble way up the front
steps to the semi-shelter of the pillars; from a face,
piteously thin, hollow eyes looked out, their glance
filled with a deep, an utter despair; a short coat
pinned together at the throat revealed the absence
of a shirt or underwear; through the cracks in the
run-over shoes the bare flesh peered; wet to the skin
as he was, he shook in the icy blast like a dog in a
wet sack. As the doors swung wide at nine o’clock
he did not lead the upward dash, but half way up
the stairs sank down, overcome by a choking fit of
coughing.</p>

<p class='c007'>I never saw him again.</p>

<p class='c007'>To live in a hovel; to drag my weary body for
miles in search of work; to cough my lungs out
like the man next door; to be submerged like a
drowning rat in a sewer; this will be my life in
Chicago. My eyes ache from gazing at confined
spaces; across the way the bare walls rise; down the
canyon streets I see the black ants of humanity
crawl; overhead the sky is leaden.</p>

<p class='c007'>Oh, my beautiful, my California! The whistle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>of the quail on the open benches is calling me; the
mating songs of the mocking birds vibrate in my
heart. Up the wide valley the warm wind sweeps,
heavy with the fragrance of blossoming trees; on the
uplands brilliant masses of flaming poppies and
the silvery blue of slender lupines spread a feast of
colour for my weary eyes; oranges blaze out in
golden glory against the dark green foliage of the
thrifty groves; the deep blue of the cloudless sky
seems infinite in depth; and in the purple distance the
white-capped peaks of San Bernardino and Grayback
rear their lofty heads.</p>

<p class='c007'>Eureka, I’ve found it—the Great Idea—the craziest
scheme that ever popped into a woman’s head!</p>

<p class='c007'>We’re going home—back to California on a tandem
bicycle. We’ll carry a cooking and sleeping
outfit with us, stop wherever the night finds us,
work when we can get it, and somehow, with God’s
help, we’ll win through.</p>

<p class='c007'>And it has come about in the strangest way. Dan
got a chance to help a man he knows clean out an
old barn which is to be converted into a garage,
and in the loft along with the accumulation of
years, they ran across a tandem bicycle which is in
excellent condition. The owner gave it to Dan’s
friend who thought he could sell it for something,
even though cycling is out of date.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Dan told me of the occurrence an intense
longing for the open road leading into the west
surged over me, but I could see no way of securing
the wheel since our funds totalled less than five
dollars.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Then I said to myself, “There is a way. You
must find it,” and resolutely set my subconscious
mind to the task.</p>

<p class='c007'>A day passed and another. Then over the
threshold of consciousness came the recollection of
my one cherished possession—a beautiful opera
cloak.</p>

<p class='c007'>On that fateful morning in April, 1906, after the
rush to escape from the tottering building, I found
myself on the streets of San Francisco in somewhat
scanty attire, but folded warmly in my new biscuit-coloured
evening wrap. Many thanks I offered up
for its protection in the chilly days and nights that
followed. Then, when conditions had returned
somewhat to normal, a good cleaning and remodelling
restored almost its pristine glory, and again it
gave good service on the honeymoon. While the
panic was sweeping away all our possessions, I laid
it aside, resolved that it at least should be retained
throughout the storm.</p>

<p class='c007'>But a sterner necessity compelled, so taking it
from the drawer, I wended my way to Oak Street and
there held a colloquy with our friend’s wife. The
cloak caught her fancy at once, the bargain was
struck, and I trundled home my prize in triumph,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>to lean it carefully near the door of our crowded
quarters.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here at dusk, Dan, entering hurriedly, collided
violently with an outstanding pedal. He hopped
agilely about on one foot, clasping his left shin in
an affectionate embrace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What in hades is that thing I just fell over?” he
demanded hotly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That? Why, that’s our through ticket to California.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As I turned up the ineffective gas jet he recognised
the graceful lines of the machine.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’ll be darned!” he ejaculated. “So you
got the blooming thing from Dave, did you? How’d
you manage it? And what do you mean, anyway,
by a ticket to California? You can’t be aiming to
ride that contraption.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you dare to call my beautiful green tandem
a contraption. You’ll be glad enough to take
your seat on a bicycle built for two as soon as I’ve
explained my perfectly scrumptious scheme to you.
We’ll fix up a light cooking outfit, tie our blankets
on behind, and away we’ll glide out into the west.
We’ll work along the way and have lots of interesting
experiences; I’ll get rid of this tiresome cough,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>and after awhile we’ll get home—home, do you
hear? Back to California.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ride that thing to California! Why think of
the country between here and the coast; look at the
desert, look at the Rocky Mountains, to say nothing
of the little old Coast Range. What do you think
I am, anyhow, a cross between a camel and a mountain
goat?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll be sure you’re all goat if you butt into my
cherished plan in that rude fashion,” I responded
gaily. “Never mind. Wait till your shin feels better
and you’ve had something to eat and we’ll talk
it over.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I drew the table closer to our tiny stove and set
out the meal while Dan prepared for supper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You remember my telling you about that poor
little couple that I used to see at the Public Library,”
I began when we were comfortably settled, “the
ones that used to come in about two or three o’clock
and go off in a corner somewhere to eat a bit of
lunch when the librarian wasn’t looking? She’s
been going down very fast for the last few weeks,
hasn’t been able to look for work at all, but waited
in the library till he came in, half crazy from the
continued failure to find anything, and then she’d
try to comfort him while they shared the part of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>loaf of bread that she’d have hidden beneath her old
cape.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When I was warming up in the library this
morning she was coughing terribly and I talked her
into trying the charity hospitals again. It seemed
as if they must take her. You know she went a
while back, but couldn’t get in; she was an ambulatory
case. He came in about noon, all used up
and they didn’t have even a crust of bread.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We started out and just on the edge of the sidewalk
she had a hemorrhage and before we could get
the ambulance she was dead. I had taken her in
my arms, her little body was light as a feather.”
My voice failed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll never forget the look in his eyes when he
realised that she was dead.... Dan, I can’t die
as she did. Before I go I want to see the open fields,
feel the soft earth beneath my feet, draw a few
breaths of real air. Since I’ve lived in this slum
I’m getting so I can’t even believe in God.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ethel, you’re getting morbid. What’s all this
talk about dying? You’re simply upset over these
people’s trouble.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I’m not morbid, Danny boy. I hate to tell
you, but Doctor Graves says I have consumption
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>and must go back to California at once if I’m to get
well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What utter nonsense. You’re the strongest
woman I’ve ever seen. It’s ridiculous to talk of a
strapping girl like you having consumption.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know it sounds ridiculous, but I’m afraid it’s
true just the same. I’ve had a good many symptoms&nbsp;... but I won’t die like an animal in a trap. I
won’t die in this pest hole. I’ve a fighting chance
and I’m going to take it. We’ll ride that tandem
west or die in the attempt. When I think of the
terrors of the journey, the miles and miles of desert
that I know so well, when I picture those tremendous
mountains, my heart almost fails me, but nothing,
nothing can be so terrible, so horrible to our
souls as well as destructive to our bodies as these
loathsome slums.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ve got to get away from here, Dan. That’s
all. And I believe we can go to California on that
wheel. I’ve heard of people making the journey on
foot, and in the early days whole families went with
all sorts of conveyances. What we need is a little
nerve and grit like the pioneers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Well into the night we argued, until Dan was
finally silenced, if not fully convinced.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Then the question of equipment confronted us.
A matter of a few tools for repairs on the journey,
an extra tire and other insurance against accidents
reduced our finances almost to zero. Also the problem
of bulk and weight is a serious matter when
clothing, bedding, cooking utensils and other necessaries
must be carried on one small frame.</p>

<p class='c007'>As usual, the front seat of the bicycle is arranged
for the woman, and on the handle bars we have
rigged a holder for the cooking outfit. This consists
of a heavy frying pan with the handle removed,
a fair-sized potato kettle with bail, useful for carrying
water, nested inside, and within that again a
strong tin pan with close-fitting cover which may
be used as coffee pot, cocoa kettle or dish pan as
occasion warrants. Dan has a pair of long-handled
pliers to remove these from the fire. Inside the pan
lie two tin plates and two tin cups for coffee; also
a couple of forks, a sharp steel knife, one large and
two small spoons and a small tin of salt. A cocoa
can of sugar, one of coffee and one of cocoa fit together
very nicely and complete the collection. Directly
on the rack rest two heavy pieces of wire
sharpened at the ends which are bent at right angles
to the body, forming prongs about nine inches long.
When the points of these prongs are driven into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>ground so that the lengths are parallel and about
eight inches apart, a convenient little support for
frying pan and kettle is formed, under which a
small fire can be kindled to great advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Dan contrived a case to fit within the body
of the frame, which, with careful packing, holds a
small emergency case, fitted with simple instruments,
bandages, etc., a few toilet necessities and a change
of hose and underwear for each.</p>

<p class='c007'>Behind the rear seat there is a large rack with
leather straps for bedding, which is our worst problem.
Dan made a trip to a big machine shop and
returned triumphant with two large sheets of black
oilcloth which had covered electrical equipment.
To each sheet I sewed a woollen blanket, thus giving
our future bed protection from damp above and below.
When an extra shirt for Dan and a waist for
myself was added to this bed roll, we found that we
could just crowd in one soft old blanket for extra
covering. When I consider sleeping on the ground
with a combination oilcloth and woollen blanket
below, and the two blankets above, my teeth fairly
chatter with anticipation. But even a frozen death
would be preferable to our present hopeless existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inasmuch as our rent is due next Sunday, May
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>3rd, we have decided to start on that date. What
the future holds, God alone knows, but at least we
will live in the open, which will compensate for
much.</p>

      <div class='line'><i>May 4th. In a big barn.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We are off!</p>

<p class='c007'>Sunday dawned bright and clear and Dan and I
were up with the first light. The neighbourhood
assembled to receive our few poor sticks of furniture
and household goods, for we deemed it best to give
the things to our poverty-stricken neighbours rather
than sell them for a few pennies to some secondhand
dealer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our friends think us insane, as well they may,
but crazy or no, we will see this thing through.</p>

<p class='c007'>We surely made a picture at the start. Dan’s
blue eyes were alight with eagerness, his fair hair
tousled, while his sturdy body showed to good advantage
in sweater, corduroys and cap. I wore a
dark shirtwaist, short plaid skirt, blue sweater and
straw sailor hat. At the last moment we fastened a
small parcel of groceries atop the bedding roll—a
bit of bacon, a loaf of bread, a pat of butter and one
or two other odds and ends. Altogether, the machine
was well loaded.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Then, followed by the cheers of the crowd who
were busy carrying away the contents of our room,
and accompanied by a horde of shoving, shouting
urchins, we made our way up the street. At the
corner of Division Street we paused to weigh ourselves
and wheel, and found the combination tipped
the scales at just five hundred pounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pushing on to a clear bit of pavement, we mounted
and were off toward the west side. Both Dan and
I had ridden bicycles at earlier periods in our career,
and had spent a little time in Lincoln Park practising
on the tandem, but we were far from being expert
riders. The double steering gear which should
enable the man to help the woman steady the front
wheel was broken, so, loaded as we were, I found
the task of steering a difficult one.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we wobbled our serpentine way through the
streets, fortunately nearly empty at that early hour,
it seemed to me that this was the strangest nightmare
that ever vexed the soul of woman. There was
a weird beauty in the morning light, the breath of
freedom in the gentle breeze. The spirit of adventure
rode with us. I had a feeling of detachment
from earthly things while realising to the full the
perils and difficulties of the venture.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>An ash can in the street caught my eye. With
incredible accuracy I headed for it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hi!” cried Dan, “look where you’re going.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good gracious,” I answered desperately, “that’s
just what I’m trying not to do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bang! Quite a spill, but no harm done luckily.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we reached Humboldt Park, we decided to
take a short rest. Propping our machine against the
curb, we sat on a bench beneath a tree. While aimlessly
poking the litter at its base with my toe, I saw
something glitter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look, Dan!” I exulted. “See what I’ve found.
Talk of manna in the wilderness.” I held up a
silver dollar, a half and two dimes. “I feel sure it
is an omen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, an omen of fresh eggs for breakfast to-morrow
morning,” replied Dan prosaically.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once again we were off. The day wore on.
Streets gave way to dusty roads full of ruts, into
which the wheel appeared possessed to stagger. Dust
rose; sweat poured; our throats ached with unquenchable
thirst. My arms seemed wrenched from
their sockets. Human endurance reached its limit
as the sun set.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wearily we searched for a camping place.
Finally, in a grassy hollow, screened from the road
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>by trees, we unpacked our equipment. While Dan
took the potato kettle to a near-by house for water,
I set up our wire rack and kindled a tiny fire beneath.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a meal which we were almost too tired to
eat, we spread our scanty bedding on the ground and
composed ourselves for slumber. An owl settled on
a branch near our heads and surveyed us with amazement.
Back and forth he flew, studying the strange
intruders from every angle. Then with a “hoot”
of protest and derision, he winged away to attend
to the business of the evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ugh, this ground is hard,” grunted Dan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And none too warm,” thought I, but neither cold
nor discomfort could prevail for long against our
utter exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sat up with a start. A grey day was breaking;
the trees rustled in a wind that moaned and muttered
with chilly breath. Big drops of rain beat on
my face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Quick, Dan, get up!” I cried to the snoring partner
of my dreams. “It’s going to pour down rain
in a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We scurried around, collecting and packing our
scattered belongings, then decided to make a dash
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>for a big barn which stood not far down the road at
the foot of a hill, for the rain was beginning to fall
heavily. Reaching the highway, we sprang to saddle
and sped down the hill. With a sickening lurch
the front wheel struck a slippery patch of mud at
the bottom, the hind wheel skidding sideways. The
heel of my right shoe caught in the pedal shaft and
in a trice was torn from my foot and sent spinning
ten feet away. Dan went sprawling on the wet
earth, while I hopped awkwardly along, bruising my
shins, but clinging desperately to the handle bars
with both hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan picked himself up and came to my assistance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pick up my heel, please,” said I, standing like a
stork on one foot. Dan stared at me dazedly. “Pick
up my heel,” I cried impatiently. He reached for
my foot. “Do you think I’m a horse waiting to be
shod? Don’t you see the heel of my shoe lying over
there in the mud?”</p>

<p class='c007'>With that he retrieved the loosened heel and we
hurried through the steady downpour to the barn.
The owner came out and, having listened to our tale
of woe, gave us some shingle nails to repair the torn
shoe and bade us build a fire beneath a shed to prepare
breakfast. Dan fulfilled the augury of the
previous day by the purchase of some fresh eggs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>and soon we were feasting on bacon and eggs and
pints of steaming coffee.</p>

<p class='c007'>Good? Why nectar and ambrosia were stale beside
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the meal, we repaired to the barn loft and,
easing our weary bones into the prickly depths of
hay, awaited the end of the storm.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan found work! Only a day and a half, but a
few hours were better than nothing, and gave us
hope.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sun was setting as a wagon rattled up the
road with Dan dangling his feet over the endgate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on, Ethel,” he cried, “our friend here has
offered us a place in his barn and plenty of dry corn
cobs for the fire.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I sprang up and we loaded the wheel into the
wagon. Soon the driver entered a lane which ended
in a large barnyard, and as Dan began to help with
the team, I unloaded the cooking outfit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The farmer was pulling some grain sacks from a
large tub in the wagon bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here’s plenty of fish,” he said. “Just pitch in
and help yourselves.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Our eyes bulged in astonishment at sight of the
silvery heaps that filled the tub.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where on earth did you get so many?” gasped
Dan.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“South o’ the road where the river has overflowed
its banks. The boys are heaving them out with
pitchforks and spears and even bare handed. Take
all you want. I’ve three times as many as Sarah
Jane and I can eat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing loath, I lifted out sufficient for our needs,
and as Dan set to cleaning the fish, I collected corn
cobs and kindled a tiny fire beneath the rack.</p>

<p class='c007'>A short, roly-poly woman bustled out of the back
door of the small but comfortable farmhouse and
approached us.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear me, dear me, a lady tramp!” she exclaimed.
“Bless us, if they haven’t gone to running in pairs
like animals entering the ark.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Catching sight of the tandem still loaded with
part of our equipment, she paused in amazement,
pushing back her red calico sunbonnet and revealing
wonderful masses of snow-white curls.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you’re not a tramp after all, are you?
Tramps don’t ride bicycles. What a disappointment!
I’ve always wanted to meet a lady tramp.
But what are you up to anyway? Must be something
interesting. You look interesting.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I assured her that we were, indeed, up to something
interesting, just how interesting we would
probably fully realise later on.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“So you’re really going back to that strange California
where it is always summer? What awful
monotony. Come fall, I’m always glad, for I feel
that summer has been here plenty long enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She seated herself on the wagon tongue.</p>

<p class='c007'>The barnyard world was settling for the night
with much cackling, grunting, lowing and stamping.
Under a near-by shed a flock of fowls was clucking
and fussing as they sought the highest perches.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look at those chickens, now. Aren’t they just
like humans?” demanded our visitor. “I sit out
here and watch them by the hour.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Caw, caw-rr,” croaked a haughty grenadier of a
hen, taking a sharp peck at a handsome young pullet
who had endeavoured to perch on the topmost roost.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hear what she says? I’ll tell you,” the little
woman interpreted eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Get right away from here, you impudent, upstart
dominick. Go back with the lower clawsses
where you belong and don’t try to crowd in here
with your betters.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you know, we got a woman living on the
other side of town who’s the perfect spit and image
of that old hen. There, hear her talking?</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘These nobodies try to push in everywhere.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now the old rooster is a cuttering.... ‘She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>seems rather a nice little thing, but of course, as you
say, she’ll never be able to attain to any position in
life, but really for one of her social standing, she’s
quite chick.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now the old hen’s talking again. ‘Fowls of
quality can’t be too careful nowadays. These plebeian
climbers are everywhere.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>The haughty Plymouth Rock settled herself and
preened her feathers with the conscious air of duty
well performed, while the little woman laughed
gaily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now she feels that she has maintained all the
traditions of her class. Oh, yes, they have classes
in the chicken yard just as in the American nation.
I was thinking of getting a good likeness of that
hen and sending it to the <cite>Chicago American</cite> so’s
they could print her picture on the society page.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know, I find lots of interesting characters
out here. There’s a hog over yonder. He’s stuffed
so full he can’t swallow another mouthful, yet he
keeps wallowing over the food so the shoats can’t
get any, and they stand back and first one tries to
get a bite and then another, when if they’d all rush
him at once they’d get aplenty. When he grunts
like that he’s telling them to be contented and industrious
little pigs and that if they just start rooting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>early every morning, after a while they’ll be
eminent and respected like he is and able to wallow
in the feed trough.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And Father’s got the big kettle all ready, and
Saturday he’s going to butcher him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hi, Serjane, I’ve got the fish ready for the pan
and there you set on the wagon tongue aletting the
fire go out.” It was the querulous voice of the old
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sarah Jane hurried into the kitchen as Dan placed
a fine mess of fish over the coals. We had just gotten
well started to eating when the back door flew
open with a bang and the little woman scudded toward
us.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I’m too late,” she cried breathlessly.
“You’re already eating. Now why didn’t I ask you
to eat with us before? Why? Why? Why?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Each word was a tiny explosion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just because I didn’t think! Didn’t think!
That’s what ails the world. We don’t think, won’t
think and can’t think. Now, which do you consider
is the worst?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The <i>won’t thinks</i> are the worst to my mind,” I
assured her gravely, “because the <i>don’t thinks</i> get
waked up now and then, and after a while the <i>can’t
thinks</i> will grow some more brains, so that there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>a chance of them getting started right, but as for
the fellow who just naturally refuses to think at
all, there is not much hope for him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear me, dear me. I would just love to talk to
you. You must come into the sitting room as soon
as you are done eating and spend the evening with
me. I’ll hurry and wash the dishes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She spun around and scurried into the house. We
hastily finished our meal and prepared sleeping quarters
in the hay mow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, as darkness fell, the old man ushered us
into the neat living room. The soft rays from a
large lamp glimmered on the walnut furniture and
illumined the family groups upon the walls. Braided
rugs, round and oval, were scattered about the floor
and a cheerful blaze in an open-front stove radiated
a pleasant welcome in the chill of evening. In a
few moments our hostess was extracting all the details
of our journey with the neatness and skill of
long experience.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a while Dan rose with a sigh of weariness.
“Come, Ethel, we’d better hit the hay. I’ve got to
work to-morrow, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hay—hit the hay! No such a thing. Go right
into the spare room and make yourselves uncomfortable.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Sarah Jane rushed to open the bedroom
door.</p>

<p class='c007'>I explained our plans for roughing it and said we
should rest very comfortably in the hay mow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear me, dear me, you should always put off till
to-morrow what you can get out of doing to-day.
You can do aplenty of roughing it when you get to
Wyoming. Go on to bed now and enjoy a good
spring mattress while you have the chance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Daylight came all too soon, with Sarah Jane summoning
us to a breakfast of cornmeal mush and
cream, fried perch, buckwheat cakes with maple
syrup and cups of amber coffee.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me know if you find anything that I can do
to help along. I’d like to be of more use in the
world than I can be hibernating here,” she called
after us as we pedalled down the lane.</p>

<p class='c007'>I can still see her merry smile as she leaned over
the gate, vigorously waving her sunbonnet in farewell.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We are in a new world. All day long we press
forward, sometimes riding and again on foot, for
the roads are rough and often muddy; and on every
hand the beauties of an Illinois spring unfold before
our enraptured gaze.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the western spring I am familiar. In March
and April acres on acres of greasewood blossoms and
wild lilacs were all swaying in the ocean breeze that
sweeps the wide reaches of our Southern California
valleys each afternoon. A wild spirit of freedom,
an almost Pagan joyousness and gaiety is manifest,
which speaks of primitive things and appeals to the
elemental essence of the soul. But here Nature approaches
in more tender intimacy. Little love flowers
snuggle on her breast. The whole earth palpitates
with a sweet warmth and promise of beauties
to follow.</p>

<p class='c007'>On our right stretches a crab-apple hedge in full
bloom, a veritable glory of beauty and fragrance,
which crowns a ridge whence rolling acres fall gradually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>away, revealing, here and there, farmhouses
surrounded by kitchen gardens and groups of fruit
trees, billowy plumes of soft colour, some outlined
by the tender green of spring. The smoke of noontime
fires lazily ascends from the chimneys, the
cackle of hens and other barnyard sounds come
faintly on the breeze. My heart aches with the
homing impulse. My mind turns to the experiences
of the past few days.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wednesday the air was clear and balmy, and as
night approached we stopped beneath a bridge where
thick trees screened our camp from view. The wires
were driven in the ground, the modest campfire
lighted, and soon the delicious aroma of boiling
cocoa and grilled steak whetted appetites already
ravenous.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our hunger appeased, we were settling for the
night, when I was seized with foreboding of a coming
storm. Dan laughed and called it a crazy notion
and beyond all reason. But the feeling increased
in intensity until I insisted on seeking the
shelter of some building. Dan acquiesced reluctantly,
but by the time we had repacked and loaded
the wheel, night had fallen.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the nearest farm we asked permission to sleep
in the barn, but were abruptly denied. At the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>next house the inmates refused to answer our knock.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what are you going to do now? Walk all
night?” expostulated Dan.</p>

<p class='c007'>On our left a dark mass appeared in the darkness
and proved to be the ruins of a race track grandstand.
As I stumbled beneath the tiers of seats,
hoping for some promise of protection, a man leaped
up almost at my feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>I sprang back, startled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come,” said the stranger, “I know the way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As though in a trance I followed him, my hand
guiding the wheel, while Dan pushed behind. We
immediately came on a narrow board walk at right
angles to the road. The man led on into the thick
darkness, the two of us following blindly after. On
and on we travelled as though impelled by some
force outside our own volition. A huge building
loomed on our right. Silently we skirted it, the
clop, clop of our feet on the boards giving way to
noiseless progress over grassy turf.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly the front wheel of the tandem struck
some obstacle, and in the deepened gloom I could
faintly discern the outlines of another building, the
steps of which were before me. These I mounted,
preceded by our strange guide, who said not a word,
but rapped loudly on the door.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>From some remote region came a scuffling, then
the bang of an inner door, and down a long hall
shuffled a tall, lean figure wrapped in a trailing
dressing gown. An oil lamp in its hand gave forth
a yellow gleam, which lighted up the old-fashioned
interior and shone through the glass panelled door.
The old man, for such it was, peered through the
glass at our mysterious attendant, and then, after
prolonged fumbling with lock and bolts and chain,
slowly swung open the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And who might yez be?” he inquired in a rich
brogue, directing a keen Irish eye on Dan and me.</p>

<p class='c007'>We explained our situation as briefly as possible
and asked for the shelter of some outbuilding for the
night.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Faith, and ye’re wilcome to the house. Sure and
it’s large enough for tin and but three av us to fill it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he spoke there came a tapping and a little old
woman with snapping black eyes skipped like a bird
to his side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“An’ indade they shall not come inside this house
the night. Murdthered in me bed I will not be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush, Katie,” querulously chided the ancient.
“This is no time for to be exercisin’ yer conthrary
timper.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the little old woman braced herself in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>doorway as though to defy the world, and I hastened
to state that we only wanted to sleep in the
barn.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, if so ye will. Arrah, the house is open
save for this old spalpeen.” With that he shuffled
off to fetch a lantern.</p>

<p class='c007'>I turned to thank our guide, but he had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon we were inside the big barn that we had
passed coming in. The wavering rays of the lantern
disclosed huge, cob-webbed recesses, rows of empty
stalls, a tumble-down carriage, and near the sliding
door, a small hillock of well packed hay. Otherwise
the place was empty. On this hay we made our bed
and were soon asleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was awakened by the drumming of rain on the
roof. Another wet morning was upon us. I leaned
over to ask Dan what he thought of my “crazy notion”
now. But he was sound asleep, so I conquered
my feminine impulse and decided to get up and
scout a dry place to cook breakfast.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ow-wow!” My bare foot splashed into a lake
of cold water which, concealed by a layer of floating
straw and chaff, covered the floor of the old barn to
a depth of eighteen inches.</p>

<p class='c007'>My startled howl brought Dan up with a jerk.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Hastily we dressed and moved our footgear and
bedding to the top of a grain bin. As we perched
forlornly on this refuge in a watery waste, the door
opened and the little old lady of the night before
came in.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps we appeared less murderous by the light
of day, or what is more likely, her “conthrary timper”
was less in evidence when acting on her own
initiative; at any rate, after a short chat, she cordially
invited us in to breakfast.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then followed a most interesting day. Jim, her
husband, who was unusually well read, struck up an
immediate friendship with Dan, and while waiting
for the rain to cease, Katie and I visited in the
kitchen.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were but three in the family: the old man,
his wife and the feeble-minded chore man who had
brought us to their dwelling the previous night. Outside
of an acre of orchard, a chicken run and a small
garden, their great holdings of hundreds of acres
were rented to tenants, one of whom supplied them
with milk and butter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The couple had emigrated from the old country
when very young; had met and loved on the long
voyage, and were married soon after their arrival.</p>

<p class='c007'>James Grogan was a remarkable man. Keen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>shrewd, ambitious, he worked and saved and invested
with all the energy and acumen that has enabled so
many of his race to rise in the world. He homesteaded
the original Illinois farm and to these hundred
and sixty acres he constantly added. His passion
was to leave his children educated and rich.
He himself had learned to read and write when past
the age of thirty; the struggle upward had been a
hard one; his children should be spared all this.</p>

<p class='c007'>And eleven babies were born to them. With bitter
words old Katie painted pictures of the heartbreaking
toil; the lack of ordinary conveniences; the
goading tongue of her lord and master driving her
on through the years while acre was added to acre,
and the herds increased, and no barn was large
enough to hold the abundant crops. Modern farm
implements were purchased in plenty, but there was
no money for the simplest household conveniences;
outbuildings were snug and well built; but the home
itself was ramshackle and poor.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been said that in earlier days the size of a
man’s farm could often be estimated by the number
of wives’ tombstones in his lot in the cemetery. But
it was not true in this case. Katie had lived, but
her babies died.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her love for her husband turned to a cold hate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>but still the babies came. Ten had been born and
ten had died before Jim realised that Katie needed
as good care as his animals—that she was more than
any animal—that she was, in truth, the mother of
those children—his children—whom he worshipped—and
lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>So the youngest boy was born and grew—a slender,
delicate, brilliant lad—and all the facilities for
education, and all the riches of cattle and horses and
broad acres were his to command.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was educated for the Bar. And while he was
in college and while he studied law, his father and
he built up a wonderful library and still more wonderful
plans for the future, when James Grogan,
Junior, should be a great jurist and statesman with
a reputation nation wide.</p>

<p class='c007'>Abruptly his health failed. Lack of vitality, his
inheritance from his mother, made itself felt. He
went to California and there died.</p>

<p class='c007'>James Grogan, Senior, brought home that library
and installed it in the old ramshackle house with its
addition here and lean-to there. And here, alone, he
read each volume.</p>

      <div class='line'><i>Monday, May 11th. In the Mud.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>To you, and you alone, little diary, will I confess
a sense of deep discouragement. Mud! Mud!
Seas of mud and oceans of rain!</p>

<p class='c007'>We have been out eight full days and have covered
but sixty-five miles. The appetite that I have
developed is truly amazing. As I sit by a fence,
waiting for Dan to investigate those streaks of ooze
and slush called roads, I’m hungry enough to eat
Limburger cheese, which is saying a good deal for
me. Yet I finished a hearty breakfast but an hour
or so ago. I am ravenous, morning, noon and night,
and Dan is nearly as bad. When I compare the
size of our appetites with the cost of bread and eggs
at farmhouses, the dollar and a half that Dan
sweat like a stevedore to earn, looks woefully inadequate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Saturday afternoon we cycled through the town
of Morris, stopping long enough to purchase a few
supplies. Two miles from town we passed a neat
farmhouse, and just beyond found a most beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>meadow surrounded by trees. The long shadows of
late afternoon lay across the thick green sward which
rose in a gentle slope.</p>

<p class='c007'>Delighted with the spot, we cooked our evening
meal and lay down to enjoy the glory of the moon,
which, floating above the trees, bathed the earth with
its soft radiance. The peaceful chorus of night insects
and the gentle whisper of the wind in the tree
tops soon lulled us to sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>I dreamed that we were riding over a long bridge
that suddenly gave way with a deafening crash, precipitating
us into the rushing stream below. I wakened
with a start. Alas, it was more than a dream.
The night was like ink. Lightning crackled, thunder
crashed and rolled, rain descended in torrents and
a fine young rivulet was bounding down the hillside
and pouring directly over our bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bewildered, we stumbled around in the darkness,
collecting such clothing as came to hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on,” cried Dan, “let’s make for the big
barn up the road.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Guided by the flashes of lightning, we hastened
across the field and approached the barn from above.
A momentary gleam disclosed a black opening before
me. I made a dive for the shelter within. Followed
a sickening sense of falling, and I spreadeagled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>onto some yielding, hairy object which heaved
and scrambled madly with much blowing and bellowing.
Thus I was made aware that my unseemly
arrival had disturbed the gentle slumbers of a cow.
At least I sincerely hoped that the creature belonged
to the gentler sex as I backed out of the stall with
more haste than elegance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan, meanwhile, had located the hayloft and,
guided by his voice, I groped my way to him, and
notwithstanding the stimulating companionship of
barley-beards and thistles, contrived to snatch a few
hours’ sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rain ceased about daybreak, and we returned
to the scene of the evening before to collect our
scattered utensils and spread the soaked bedding in
the brilliant sunshine. Most of our recent purchases
were ruined, the bread especially being reduced
to a soggy mass, so Dan sought the farmhouse
to renew our supply. He returned rather indignant
with less than a half loaf of bread, for which he had
paid ten cents. It then developed that the bacon had
disappeared and our dozen eggs were badly scrambled,
so Dan reluctantly went back to buy eggs and
bacon if possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a few minutes he was back empty-handed,
angry right through. The farmer had demanded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>twenty-five cents for a half dozen eggs, which had
cost us twenty cents a dozen in Morris the day before,
and when Dan declined to buy had grown insulting.</p>

<p class='c007'>We made coffee and were drinking it when a
roughly dressed man approached.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, folks,” he began, “you better clear out of
here. The boss up there is hitchin’ up a team to go
to Morris after the constable. I hearn him vow to
have you run in for trespassin’ on his land.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We looked at one another in alarm. Hastily
swallowing the last crumbs of bread, we rolled up
our wet blankets and made ready for the road, the
stranger doing all he could to help. Once on the
highway we found riding out of the question because
of the mud, and what to do we didn’t know,
especially as our friend said that the constable would
be glad enough to arrest us for the fee.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But if your wife don’t mind,” he concluded,
“you might come down to the river with me. We’re
choppin’ wood down there and the bunch’ll hide you
till the constable gets tired nosin’ around and goes
back to town.”</p>

<p class='c007'>No sooner said than done. The men took the
wheel, and away we went through the underbrush to
the woodchopper’s shack. There were four men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>there, washing clothes, shaving and attending to the
usual Sunday chores. Our adherent explained the
situation and they all hustled around to make us
comfortable. One built up the fire to dry our things,
another hid the wheel, one went out to the road to
keep watch, while the fourth arranged a place of
concealment for us in the rear of the room. Hardly
were the preparations complete, when the watcher
reported the coming of the farmer and the constable.</p>

<p class='c007'>We ducked to cover, the door was shut, and after
a bit we heard our hosts parleying with the newcomers
and demonstrating their skill in the art of
graceful lying. Soon they announced that the coast
was clear, but advised us to remain in retirement for
an hour or two at least, and, to pass the time, suggested
a trip on the river. One got out some fishing
tackle, another dug bait, while a third cut rods from
the willows. We all followed a winding path to
the river where row boats were tied, and stepping in,
were off for a little fishing excursion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hours flew by on the wings of delight, while
the men fished in cool, shady coves or rowed up
stream with the oars glinting in the sun. We had a
good catch, when dark shadows athwart our course
and a gusty breeze that set the water rippling proclaimed
the coming of another shower.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Returning to the shanty, the men prepared the
glistening spoils, and before the savoury dish was
ready for the table, the rain was pounding on the
roof.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the day waned, I became the prey of serious
misgivings, but about an hour before sundown the
rain slackened and four of the men declared their
intention of going to town to see a show, adding that
they did not expect to return till morning. Our first
acquaintance cooked a hearty meal, then rigged a
blanket curtain across one end of the room, and
warmed and dried and fed, we retired to rest, giving
thanks for the spirit of true brotherhood which often
manifests itself in unlikely places.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next morning our benefactor packed a substantial
lunch and started us on our journey. But so far we
have made poor progress.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan has just come up with the news that our one
chance to proceed lies in following the railroad track,
so I must up and away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Well, we are making a little better time along the
track than in the slush of the road, though this
method of travel is far from ideal. We push the
wheel between the rails, and the poor thing goes
bump, bump, bump over the ties, while the cooking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>outfit jingles and clinks and the whole load threatens
to fall off. When nerves can stand the strain no
longer, we try the path at the side of the track.
This we essayed to ride, but a shelving ledge where
the path almost disappeared nearly sent us down the
embankment, so we trundle the wheel and walk.
The pedal barks my shins and I feel like saying
something wicked. I hear Dan muttering under his
breath and fully second what he is thinking. Just
when I can no longer endure the pangs of starvation,
he declares that it is time to stop for lunch. Sweet
sound!</p>

<p class='c007'>Luncheon over, I throw myself face down on the
gravelled siding. When I consider the lack of
money, the scarcity of work, the wretched roads and
never-ending storms, my beloved California seems
very far away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the open door of a “side-door Pullman” I
sit at ease on our bedding roll with my diary on my
knees, watching the Iowa prairie billow past. What
a relief to view the stretches of gluey, sloppy road,
serene in the knowledge that for the present at least
we are free from its sticky toils.</p>

<p class='c007'>We lunched last Monday beside the Stockdale
siding and while packing our belongings preparatory
to another tussle with the bike, a freight train pulled
in. The train crew surveyed us with vast interest,
and as the engine backed slowly past, the engineer
leaned far out of the cab window.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whither away?” he queried.</p>

<p class='c007'>“California or bust,” yelled Dan.</p>

<p class='c007'>The long train jarred to a stop on the siding. A
brakeman appeared and entered into conversation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It must be pretty fierce to ride a wheel through
that mud,” he volunteered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You bet it is,” agreed Dan, “and the track isn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>much better. If I bark any more hide off my shins,
I’ll have to buy a pair of crutches.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With a shriek and a roar a passenger train thundered
through. The freight pulled slowly off the
siding. The engineer leaned out as before, his big,
good-natured mouth stretched in a broad grin, his
right arm swinging with a scooping motion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get aboard! Get aboard!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan and I exchanged glances. With one accord
we jumped for the wheel which stood loaded for the
start, and ran it along beside the track. Car after
car groaned past. The caboose appeared. A brakeman
leaned from the step and grasped the handle
bars, the conductor lent a hand, and in a moment
our old machine was being hoisted upon the platform
while Dan and I scrambled up the steps.</p>

<p class='c007'>Followed a detailed account of our aims and adventures,
which was listened to with keen attention.
The train crew held a council of war to determine
the best means of procedure. About half way up
the train was situated an empty box car, and to this
we were transferred as soon as darkness had fallen.
We spread our blankets on the floor and composed
ourselves for sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>But alas and alack! A new crew had come
aboard, who had chosen our resting place for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>bumper and appeared to be switching all the cars
on the middle division with it. We would enter a
siding with much grinding and jarring, coming to a
stop with a jolt. The train would be uncoupled in
the middle, our car would advance with increasing
speed, then—whang—we would bump the standing
gondolas, the train would buckle at each coupling
with a resounding thumping, the engine would jerk
us backward, and we were off to repeat the performance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Towards morning the door of the box car slid
softly open and several men piled in. Dan asked
them what they wanted and one replied, “It’s all
right, Bo. We’re west-bound bundle stiffs same as
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Great was their amazement when the morning
light revealed the presence of a woman. About sunrise,
two jumped out to “rustle some grub” while
the engine stopped for water.</p>

<p class='c007'>The train was moving out and we had given them
up, when here they came, helter skelter, and leaped
aboard the speeding car. One had some slices of
meat and bread in a newspaper, while the other carried
part of a loaf of bread. The food was unhesitatingly
divided among the five of us and was greatly
appreciated.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>The scant meal finished, we settled down to talk.
I was amazed at the mentality displayed by the
smallest fellow, a member of the I. W. W. He
seemed conversant with all the questions of the day,
and expressed in excellent language clear cut opinions
on industrial subjects that were both novel and
startling. They were all workers, but jobs were
scarce where they came from, so they were going
west in the hope of bettering their condition. The
fact that thousands were at that moment travelling
in the opposite direction, impelled by self-same conditions,
failed to deter them.</p>

<p class='c007'>One was a big, husky chap with rugged, honest
features and the true brown eyes of a Collie. His
story interested me greatly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Born among collieries, he was driven to work as a
breaker boy at a very early age by the wretched
poverty of his parents. After several years of deadening
toil at a time when he should have been in
school, he drifted away to join the great army of
migratory workers. He worked on a threshing machine
while the harvest was in progress, and at its
close what little money he had been able to save was
consumed while searching for another job. Perhaps
he got work with pick and shovel in some construction
gang, but the contractor’s system of low wages,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>high board bills, charges for physician’s care—which
most do not receive—and the like, kept him destitute.
He called at an employment office, where he
paid two dollars for a job, was worked just long
enough to pay for transportation, board and monthly
fees, then discharged without wages, his employer
and the agent dividing up the original fee. From
coast to coast he wandered, sweating in the dust and
heat of summer through long hours of racking labor,
in order to escape starvation in the idle months of
winter.</p>

<p class='c007'>His eyes grew dark and wistful as he shyly confessed
his one love affair. He had secured employment
in a little lumber mill and made such a good
impression on the boss, who was also the owner, that
he was taken to board in his own home. Here the
poor fellow got his first idea of what home life might
mean. He fell in love with the daughter of the
house, who seemed to reciprocate, but before they
could enter into any formal engagement the lumber
trust put the mill out of business, ruining the owner,
who was forced to leave that part of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Try as he would, the young man could secure no
steady employment and marriage without such foundation
was out of the question.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I saw enough of getting married on nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>when I was a boy,” he concluded. “Wages are set
for single men, I reckon. And after a bit a fellow
can’t earn a living for his family, so the wife and
kiddies have to rustle out and work. Easy enough
for them to get a job,” he added bitterly. “Many a
time I’ve seen kids doing work that I’d been glad to
get. But they can beat a man all out at working
cheap. They got to work cheap or starve. I may
be a good-for-nothing bundle stiff, but I’ve never got
so low as to live off the work of little children.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our good business men are not so finicky,” broke
in the I. W. W. “A big profit looks good to them.
If it comes from the coined sweat and blood of
women and children, so much the better. Yes,
women are cheaper than men, and kids are cheaper
than women. After a bit they’ll get machines that
are cheaper than kids, and then the brats can rot in
the slums for all they care.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why not let the people in general own the machines
and run them for use instead of for profit?
Then the men could do the work, the women could
stay at home and the children go to school.” Thus
spoke the quiet member of the trio.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shut up, you crazy socialist!” exclaimed the I.
W. W. “You fellows won’t do anything but vote.
You leave it to us. We’re the boys who’ll fix the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>machines, all right, all right. Yes, and the plutes,
too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I remembered the many I. W. W. signs and notices
that were posted along the way; the groups of
men beneath the water tanks who listened eagerly to
the harangues of such as he. Some even had told
me that they had given up liquor because it blunted
their faculties at a time when brains were needed in
the workers’ fight against the capitalists. I seemed
to hear a muttering as of a gathering storm; perhaps
in the days preceding the French Revolution a similar
murmuring rose.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are so many like my dark-eyed acquaintance.
He lost touch with his sweetheart, lost hope,
lost ambition and now drifts aimlessly about the
country in search of a bare subsistence.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is he and the millions of his class who quarry
the stone and hew the timber for our cities; they
build the roadbed and lay the tracks for swiftly
turning Pullman wheels; they mine the coal that
warms our dwellings; they harvest the wheat that
nourishes our bodies; without their labour industry
would cease.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet life to them holds out no hope, no promise;
their meagre earnings forbid the thought of marriage;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>their only home is some saloon; their final
rest the potter’s field.</p>

<p class='c009'>About ten o’clock a trainman poked his head inside
the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hey, clear out, you fellows. This is no place
for you when we enter the yard. Better beat it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The hoboes bade us adieu and sprang from the
car. The brakeman leaped in beside us.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We finish our run at the next stop,” he said.
“The engineer will slow down at the outskirts of
town and you jump off and hike out. You’ll find
the main road over to the north.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We thanked him warmly for his kindness and
made ready to follow his advice. Soon the train
slowed to a mere crawl. Dan leaped down and ran
alongside, I swung out the wheel, which he seized,
and in an instant I was standing beside him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Waving farewell to the train crew, who had all
turned out to see us off, we struck out for the main
road. The straggling outskirts of a good-sized town
lay before us.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell you what,” I remarked after we had
traversed some distance. “Suppose we stop in the
residence section and look for work. I’ll offer to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>washing or cleaning by the day, and you can cut the
lawn, wash the automobile or something.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan replied with a snort of righteous indignation.
“Ever since you were bit by the crazy bug and
started out to be a lady hobo you have lost all your
natural pride, Ethel. It was bad enough for me, a
high-class electrical engineer with a paid-up union
card in my pocket, to stoop to the job of a common
labourer as I did last week for your sake. Now I’ll
be damned if I become a dirty roustabout and have
some old hen ordering me around while I sweep off
the front porch.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, all right,” I answered cheerily. “But the
interesting hour of high noon approacheth. Will
you please be so kind as to furnish me with exact
information regarding your financial standing? I
am pained to confess myself the victim of a too
familiar craving which calls aloud for attention.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan thrust his hand into his pocket and withdrew
a solitary ten cent piece, nor did a prolonged search
of numerous pockets yield further riches.</p>

<p class='c007'>“’Tis sad,” I sighed, “but a still voice tells me
that that bit of silver will prove strangely inadequate
to the demands of nature. However, no doubt you
can dine off your natural pride, served up on your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>paid-up union card, while I eat a dime’s worth of
doughnuts or something.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We approached a rather pretentious place as I
spoke. A large brass sign announced “J. Stanchley
Loane, M.D., Physician and Surgeon.” I paused
to study the white house with the red-roofed garage
in the rear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This looks like a good place to make a start.
Think I’ll just go in and call on my fellow practitioner
and see what happens.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan stepped in front of me. “Now see here,
Ethel!” he began angrily. “Don’t go to pulling off
foolish stunts. You are my wife and I absolutely
forbid you to go about like an Irish washerwoman
and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now see here, Dan!” I mimicked, breaking in
upon his authoritative harangue, “I am your wife,
’tis true, but sad to say, the fact does not prevent me
from growing hungry. ’Tis also true that I am only
a graduate physician with a high-class appetite. I
have no paid-up union card to stand between me and
possible employment with its promise of a square
meal. Moreover, I have never felt myself to be so
wonderfully superior to the Irish washerwomen who
earn an honest living by honest labour. At any
rate, I shall not attempt to hold myself above them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>unless I can prove by my conduct that I have that
right. Just now I fail to see how either you or I
can do better than by marching up to that back door
and asking for work like the genuine bundle stiffs
that we are. Of course if you desire to remain here
on the curb, upholding your dignity while I ask
for employment, you are entirely at liberty to do so.
As for me, I’m going in right now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As I turned up the concrete driveway Dan leaned
the wheel against the fence and followed. I rapped
at the door of the screen porch. The inner door was
opened and a heavy-set man with bristling, reddish
hair stepped out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good morning, Doctor Loane,” I began. “My
husband and I are cycling to California, and being
short of funds are looking for employment. My
husband is an excellent mechanic and will be glad to
go over your car for you. I can cook, wash, scrub
or do any kind of housework.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctor looked us up and down with an insolent
stare.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So you can cook, can you? Suppose you come
in and show what you can do. I’m alone in the
house to-day. We have a devilish time with servants.
Our last maid—a pretty little fool—got on
her high horse and quit us yesterday, and the old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>harridan of a cook followed suit. My wife’s gone
to town to get another bunch.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sit down on the porch, you,” he ordered Dan,
“and you step in here. There is the pantry and the
ice chest. Throw together some sort of lunch and
call me when it’s ready.” He waved his hand with
a lordly air and disappeared into the front of the
house.</p>

<p class='c007'>A short inspection enabled me to determine on a
suitable menu, and soon a very fair lunch was spread
on the dining table.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Humph! You are quite a clever piece of goods,”
the doctor volunteered, as I summoned him to the
meal. “Go and feed your man now, and later we’ll
find something more for you to do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The meal concluded, Dr. Loane took Dan to the
garage, while I whisked the dishes away and tidied
the kitchen. The doctor entered as I finished my
task.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is some work to be attended to in my private
office, and you are just the one to do it for me,”
he grinned ingratiatingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>I felt my face growing hot as I realised what he
meant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What work do you want me to do?” I asked, rising
to my feet.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>He advanced with outstretched arms, a bestial
demon looking out of his red-brown eyes. I backed
behind the table, fury and dread causing my heart
to beat tumultuously.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just then a short ring came at the side entrance.
Dr. Loane drew back with a muttered curse. We
stood motionless for a moment. The bell rang
again, insistently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You, you keep quiet now. Remember what you
are,” he hissed, and strode to the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>I lost no time in dashing to the garage, where I
found Dan tinkering with the car.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, Dan, quick! Let’s get out of here,” I
cried.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s up, Ethel?” He came out wiping his
hands on a piece of waste.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind an explanation. I’ll tell you later.”
I spoke imperiously. “Get the wheel now and don’t
stop to talk.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We started in the direction of the business section
of the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think we had better take the wheel over by the
railroad yard, Dan, and see if you can’t arrange for
us to take a freight out of here. I’m a trifle nervous
about that old beast of a doctor. He impressed me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>as the kind of man to make us trouble if possible,
have us arrested or something.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the station I waited for Dan to see what arrangements
he could make. In a few moments he
returned to the waiting-room door with a troubled
countenance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A freight is going to pull out in about an hour,
but I haven’t been able to make any impression on
the crew. You know, the rules are pretty strict
against carrying passengers on freight trains and the
boys are afraid of their jobs. I think we’d better
give up the idea and ride out on the bike. I cached
it down at the end of the yard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I’d better talk to the trainmen, Dan,” I
replied seriously. “I’d like to get away as soon as
possible. I am afraid the doctor may make trouble
for us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We walked up the track to where a freight engine
was puffing back and forth placing cars in a long
train, like a fussy old woman stringing beads. A
lean-jawed man in blue denim with a conductor’s
cap pulled over his eyes turned at our approach.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good evening, Conductor,” I began, looking him
full in the face. “We have no money and we must
get out of this town immediately. I should like to
put our bicycle, which is down at the end of the yard,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>in some empty car that you are going to take out
to-night, and get a lift for fifteen or twenty miles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His keen grey eyes bored into mine. “What’s the
trouble that you got to get out of town? Been holding
up somebody?” he queried gruffly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My husband and I rode into town this morning
and started to hunt work as usual. We stopped at
a doctor’s house over on the north side, Doctor
Stanchley Loane’s, and he gave us work for the day.
His wife was out, my husband was cleaning the auto
in the garage, and while I was at work in his private
office, he attacked me. I gave him the slip and
got away. Now, if we ride the wheel out of town,
I’m afraid he’ll make trouble for us. He expects
us to go that way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The old son-of-a——” the conductor stopped
abruptly. “He’s a bad egg all right. We all know
that, but I scarcely thought he’d dare go so far. Of
course, your being a sort of hobo——” He stopped
again. “Reckon he didn’t take a very close look at
those shoulders of yours, or he wouldn’t have tried
to get fresh. Well, we’ll see what can be done.
Where did you say your wheel is?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan described its location.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right. You go there and be ready. We’ll
shunt an empty down that way and when the coast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>seems clear, you pile aboard and lie low. It’s a risky
business, but it’s all in a lifetime.” He turned away
and began signalling the engineer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan and I scuttled down the track. When we
had the wheel in hand, ready for loading, he turned
to me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did that old devil actually try to lay hands on
you? Why didn’t you tell me when you came out
to the garage? I’d like to go back and crack his
nut for him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m glad enough to get out of the nasty scrape
without any skull-cracking. You must remember
that we are looked upon as hoboes, and hoboes have
no rights. I do wish the men would hurry with
that car.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As though in answer to my thought, a box car
rolled gently down the track and came to a stop not
ten feet from where we waited.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good shot,” said Dan as we slid back the side
door, which was ajar.</p>

<p class='c007'>A long look around and I scrambled in, while Dan
hoisted up the wheel and quickly followed. The
bottom of the car was packed solid with radiators,
which were piled almost to the top in the rear end,
each tier held in place by heavy braces. We stacked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>the tandem in a convenient corner and crouched in
silence on the crates.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon there came a clinking rumble, there was a
slight jar, and our car moved up the line to take its
place in the outgoing train.</p>

<p class='c007'>An hour or more passed while the train roared
on. Dan sat by the door, while I, lulled by the
clank of wheels and the panting breath of the engine
that was whirling us homeward, leaned against the
radiator braces in the centre of the car and lost myself
in dreams.</p>

<p class='c007'>Came a shriek of the whistle, a grinding crash,
and the floor of the car seemed to buckle under me
while something dealt me a terrific blow between the
shoulders, lifting me clear into the air and flinging
me headlong against the front timbers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Consciousness struggled back from the void of
nothingness and I heard Dan’s agonised voice in
my ear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My God, Ethel, speak to me. Are you hurt?
Oh, she doesn’t answer! She can’t be dead! Ethel!
Ethel!”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he dragged my limp body toward the door a
flaming torture seared my lungs, my mouth filled
with a hot, brackish fluid. “Wait,” I gasped, half
strangled. “Let me rest a moment. I’ll be all right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>in a minute.” He must not know my plight. I
turned my head away as his groping fingers caressed
my hair, thankful for the thick darkness as I freed
my mouth of blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, thank God! Thank God!” he was whispering
softly as he tried to lift me in his arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me lie flat for a little while, dear. Then
I’ll get up. Are you all right?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I’m O.K. It wasn’t a regular wreck. We
must have run into something. The shock threw
the radiators about. The air seemed full of them,
but I got off scot free. You and the tandem and
the radiators were all in a scramble. I thought I
should never get you out. You’re sure you are not
hurt?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I feel rather shaken, but I believe there is nothing
serious the matter. I had a rap that put me out
for a few minutes, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What happened?” called Dan to the conductor
who approached with a lantern as I finished scrubbing
the blood from my face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A drunken bum stalled his team on the crossing.
The engine rounded the curve and was within a
hundred feet before Sam saw the wagon. The good-for-nothing
sot was off in front of the horses, else
he would be in kingdom come. How did you come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>out? Did it shake you up much when Sam set the
emergencies?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My wife had a pretty thorough pounding. The
blamed radiators broke loose and piled up in the
front of the car. Guess we’d better try another
Pullman or clear out altogether. What do you want
to do, Ethel?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, let’s ride as far as we can. Even a freight
train covers ground so quickly compared to our slow
old wheel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right, but we’d better hunt another carriage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The conductor stood hesitating. “This radiator
car is billed straight through to Frisco,” he informed
us. “I picked her out for that reason. There ain’t
many cars left open like she is. Don’t know how it
comes she ain’t sealed shut. But if you have real
good luck, you might be able to skate right through
to Frisco in a week or ten days. It’ll be a pretty
rough trip, but if you want to get to Cal in a hurry,
it’ll beat pumping a bike.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Dan, we must try it. I’d ride the bumpers
or the cowcatcher to get home in a week,” I cried,
forgetting my pain in such a joyful prospect.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It seems a trifle risky to trust those radiators
again, but you’re the doctor, so here goes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As Dan settled down beside me the conductor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>slipped a bill into his hand and ducked away.
The engineer signalled that he was ready to be off.
When the train took the next siding to permit repairs
on the engine, Dan secured a lantern and we
straightened our tangled possessions and made ourselves
as comfortable as possible for the night.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was glad when Dan slept, for I feared he would
notice my restless seeking for some posture in which
I could forget my aches and pains in sleep. But
my hopes were in vain, for mind and body conspired
to hold my nerves at a tension. The events of the
day, which seemed of a month’s duration, formed a
kaleidoscopic jumble in my brain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning dawned at last and I lay prone on the
radiator crates, while Dan busied himself with the
tandem, which had also suffered in the mêlée of the
evening before.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was nearly dark when we pulled into the railroad
yard at Des Moines. Our car was switched off
the main track, and Dan immediately got out to
purchase provisions for the western trip. Trembling
at every noise, I awaited his return, and it was not
long till he was back with an armful of bundles and
a kettle of water. Another train was being made
up and soon our car was shunted into place. The
engineer had given the signal for the crew to assemble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>and my breath had begun to come easier, when
the door was jerked open and a man thrust in his
head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hey, yous! Come out of that,” he snarled.
“Here, Tim, I’ve found a couple of boes. Come on
out now,” as we made no move. “If you don’t,
you’ll wish you had in about two seconds.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Slowly Dan clambered out. I followed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What to hell have we here? Blamed if it ain’t
a woman!” the detective cried.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tim, meanwhile, advanced with a lantern, and
having given us a close inspection, leaped into the
car.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What in blazes is this?” he exclaimed, catching
sight of the wheel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan explained shortly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, yank her out of here. This car moves in
about two minutes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan sprang inside and lowered the wheel to me.
Tim threw our bundles to the ground. “Toot, toot,”
whistled the engine. The train pulled out.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the familiar car moved away, my heart seemed
breaking. All my hopes of reaching California in a
few days crashed to the ground; thoughts of the
fierce railroad detectives, the waiting jail, the courtroom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>in the morning, surged over me. I burst into
tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What ya goin’ t’ do wid ’em, Joe? Run ’em
in?” queried Tim.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Naw, don’t believe I will. Come, now,” turning
to us. “Beat it out o’ here and don’t let me catch
yous fooling around this yard any more. Go on.
Beat it quick.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Glad enough to escape, we stumbled up the track
through the darkness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aw now, aw now,” said a hoarse voice at my
elbow. “It’s pretty fierce luck, all right. But never
you mind, lady, we’ll get you out of here all right.
Just come right along to our shack and we’ll fix you
up fine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In a few minutes we came to a tiny one-room
shanty, formed from an old car, which was fitted up
with a stove, bunks, a table and chairs. My kindly
guide set out soap, clean towels and a fine, big basin
of hot water. What luxury! I plunged my grimy
hands into the grateful depths and laved my blackened,
tear-stained face.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Dan had made a refreshing toilet, we sat
down to the first real meal in two days. Our friends,
the car inspectors, watched us eat with much satisfaction
while discussing the best method of getting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>us safely out of Des Moines. Picking up his switchman’s
lantern, one stepped out and soon returned
with the report that an empty car would go out in
a freight that left about two o’clock.</p>

<p class='c007'>The men conducted us by a circuitous way to a
cattle car, the bottom of which was covered with a
thick layer of clean straw. The detectives had already
examined and passed this car, so under the
protection of the car inspectors, it was quite safe to
climb aboard. Our wheel was hoisted in and laid
flat in a corner, and after an attempt to express our
gratitude—really too deep for words—we ourselves
lay down and were well covered with straw. I fell
asleep immediately.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rays of a lantern, which was thrust within a
few inches of my face, aroused me. The train was
grinding to a stop, and as I blinked stupidly in the
sudden light, I heard voices deep in argument.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I tell you, they’re no spotters. She has an honest
face.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And another voice answered, “Well, let ’em ride
to the next station and ask ’em a few questions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The lantern flashed the signal, and once more we
were under way.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “brakie” settled himself in the straw. Dan
produced his union card, our marriage license and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>other papers to prove our identity; the wheel was
uncovered for inspection, and a few questions confirmed
the brakeman in his opinion of our honesty.
At the next stop the conductor joined us and agreed
to move us into a closed car before daylight.</p>

<p class='c007'>So to-day we rest in comfort and despite the ache
of bruised and stiffened shoulders I am happy in the
thought that to-morrow’s dawn will see us close to
Council Bluffs.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last I know the joys of domestic service. The
pleasures of the “hired girl” and all the privileges
and emoluments pertaining to her high estate have
been mine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our good friends, the train crew, who carried us
out of Des Moines, dropped us off at the first little
station east of Council Bluffs early in the morning
of May 15th. We determined to cycle into town,
get breakfast and look for work. We were making
good time and had entered the suburbs when, as we
spun around a corner and approached a large red
house, surrounded by a tall hedge, a series of brain-piercing
shrieks rent the air. My control of the
wheel was none too steady that morning and the
shock was too much for frayed nerves and stiffened
muscles. The tandem took the bit in its teeth and
in a jiffy had buried its nose in the thick branches
at the base of the hedge. I landed on my feet, and
through a break in the shrubbery saw the cause of
the commotion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>In an angle of the enclosure a red hen was flapping
and squawking, her brood of downy chickens dashing
hither and thither, pursued by a large mongrel dog.
Within a high wire fence, evidently the chicken
yard, a moon-faced woman stood like a marionette,
her fat hands shooting into the air with a rhythmic
precision which synchronised perfectly with the
dropping of her lower jaw which opened widely with
each vocal effort.</p>

<p class='c007'>As I stared, the dog captured a tiny chick and
tossed it high in air. I dashed forward and seized
the brute by the scruff of the neck and dragged it,
growling and struggling, to the break in the hedge
where Dan came to my assistance and sent the animal
howling down the road.</p>

<p class='c007'>I turned back to the frightened brood and was
joined by the female calliope. Together we gathered
the cowering mites from their places of concealment
among the grass and weeds and at last saw the
mother safe in the coop, her decimated family huddled
about her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know chickens, oh, you know,” the lady
puffed. “These are prize birds—all, all prize stock—I
paid an outrageous price for them—Tamas said
it was very shortsighted to do so—but you know
chickens.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“I couldn’t stand idly by while that hateful dog
mangled the little things,” I interrupted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course not, with prize stock like these. You
know, oh, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan approached with the tandem, the front tire of
which was sadly flattened.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Got a puncture when you rammed the hedge.
Guess we’ll have to camp here till I can patch the
inner tube. Maybe you can buy a few eggs and
cook breakfast. I’m nearly starved.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not these eggs. Not these eggs. These are all
prize stock, every one a prize winner.” The arms
of the moon-faced madam made an upward sweep.
I clapped my hands over my ears instinctively. But
a compassionate Fate in the shape of a young girl
intervened.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Breakfast’s ready, Ma’am,” she sang out. “Mr.
MacBride says he will be right in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A tremendous struggle was mirrored in my lady’s
open countenance. She looked at the “prize chickens,”
turned toward the house, shot a covert glance
at Dan, gazed anxiously at the chickens again. It
was a solemn moment. But fear and hospitality
triumphed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maybe you better come in. I don’t know what
Tamas will say. But the dog would have killed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>more—all prize stock—so shortsighted of me....”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus rambling on, she led the way into the house,
while the maid stared unbelievingly. It came my
turn for wonderment when I caught sight of the
breakfast table. It was loaded with great bowls of
oatmeal, cream, sausage, eggs, potatoes, and a heaping
plate of graham or oatmeal gems. An odour
of hot cakes spoke of more food to follow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must wait till Tamas has finished. Just
sit down here. I hear him coming now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Our hostess turned in much agitation as a long,
cadaverous individual entered the door. He halted
and fixed us with a hostile glare.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, Tamas, now—this lady saved my prize
doggins from a chick—oh, dickens from a chog—oh,
oh, what am I saying!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan uttered a strangled snort. The mingled horror
and wrath on Tamas’ face was indescribable.
His unfortunate wife once more essayed an explanation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He—he was going to suck the eggs. But I told
him they were all—all prize eggs. Then I thought
it best to bring them in here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Probably under the circumstances it was the
safest thing to do, ah. So you go about the country
begging, do you?” He turned to Dan. “I am surprised,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>surprised and pained. Your wife—I presume
she is your wife?—appears quite intelligent,
ah.” He dragged out each word as from the depths
of ultimate wisdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’ll admit that my wife does show gleams
of intelligence at times,” Dan responded gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Those thoroughbred fowls are provoking, most
provoking, ah.” Mr. MacBride turned to his palpitating
wife. “You see, my dear, how very shortsighted
it was of you to bargain for them while I
was in Omaha. Such a waste and loss—no profit.
I shall be compelled to foreclose on old lady Martin’s
poultry farm next week, which will give us
some of the finest fowls in this county,—and at absolutely
no expense for feed and care, no bother, no
annoyance. All profit, clear profit, mark you that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He licked his lips physically and metaphorically
as he seated himself at the table and attacked a bowl
of oatmeal and cream. His performance reminded
me of a dredger I once saw at work in the Sacramento
Valley. The spoon work was wonderful—his
only rival in endless chain effect being a Chinaman
with chopsticks.</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl removed the empty bowl and replaced it
with a plate heaped with sausage, eggs and fried
potatoes, which Mr. MacBride fell upon with undiminished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>zeal, his wife meanwhile plying us with
questions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You, I take it, are presumably working people—that
is, you will no doubt accept employment if such
is presented to you,” he began after a prolonged
period of uninterrupted labour. “Now, there is one
grave failing to which the working classes of America
abandon themselves, ah. They eat too much.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With consummate skill he flipped into his thin-lipped,
rapacious mouth an enormous forkful of
sausages and potatoes, which he swallowed at a
single gulp.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have read scientific articles, articles written by
experts, which prove with mathematical accuracy
that a workingman can live comfortably on nine
cents a day, ah.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tamas knows, oh, he knows,” chirped his wife
delightedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But the average workingman’s outlay is far,
far beyond reason. This whole nation is suffering
from extravagance and overfeeding, ah.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But thousands of people, in the cities especially,
eat scarcely enough to sustain life,” I ventured.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Slums, bah, slums, human dregs unworthy of an
intelligent man’s consideration. Of course, they
live in poverty. Why not? It is all their own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>fault,—lack of thrift, extravagance and laziness.”
He paused to drain a cup of tea.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But there is never any real poverty in the country
districts. Now this community, for instance, is
prosperous, most prosperous. I never get less than
8 per cent. on my loans.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That certainly does speak well for the community
and yourself,” I conceded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I flatter myself that I am a good business man,
an excellent example of the pure American type,
conservative, patriotic, a solid all-round citizen.
But our low, ignorant foreigners must be educated.
I have endeavoured to collect a fund among our
leading merchants to secure a teacher to inculcate an
idea of thrift. Such work should really be done by
the government. Thrift, ah—the lack of thrift is
the curse of this nation. Just imagine the business
gain if our extravagant working class could be
brought to live on nine cents a day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I don’t understand,” I murmured, eyeing
him with interest. “If your patrons ate less, they
might save money, and then they would not borrow
money of you at 8 per cent. interest, and the prosperity
of this community would suffer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not at all, not at all.” He leaned forward with
a first suggestion of animation. “With the price of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>land as it is, the cost of farm implements, the high
taxes on improvements and the irregularity of crops,
it is simply impossible for a man of small capital to
escape a mortgage. Now the point is this. With
the present high cost of living, the farmer pays even
a moderate interest of 8 per cent. say, with extreme
difficulty. But with proper instruction in thrift, I
have no doubt rates could be raised to 12 per cent.
and still not prove prohibitive.” He paused to butter
a muffin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hold land that I purchased for a song years ago.
I hold it unimproved as the advance in land values,
as the small farmers come in, amply repays me. But
some of it I subdivided and sold at fat prices. Why,
one of those farms has been foreclosed on five times
in the last fifteen years. Each owner has added improvements,
of course, but not what they should
have done. If I could have had a series of really ambitious
men on it, I now would own one of the finest
farms in this section. But my farmers don’t seem
to understand thrift.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He sighed heavily as the maid set out the remains
of the meal for our consumption. Dan, no doubt
deeming imitation the sincerest flattery, seemed bent
on equalling his host’s remarkable performance as
trencherman. Mr. MacBride eyed each mouthful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>with scowling anguish, while with each succeeding
minute his wife’s agitation increased.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Really, my good man, your appetite is excessive,
positively abnormal. I had thought of permitting
you to work a few days for your board and lodging,
but that is manifestly impossible. It would never
do. Moderation, my good man, moderation should
be the keynote in all things.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We passed from the MacBride domicile in comparative
quiet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan soon had the puncture repaired and the wheel
ready for the road. We mounted and presently were
gliding through the streets of Council Bluffs.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few hours’ inquiry convinced Dan of his inability
to get work at his trade, but he heard that
there was a chance of employment on a truck farm
east of town, so we rode out to locate the place.</p>

<p class='c007'>After some argument, we were engaged, I to do
the housework, Dan to work in the fields. The
farmer first offered a dollar a day between us, but
we finally secured a dollar and a half a day and
board. We were immediately put to work tying
bunches of radishes, onions and other vegetables
for market.</p>

<p class='c007'>About ten in the evening, as we went to the bare
room assigned us, the woman handed me an alarm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>clock set for four A. M. with orders to serve breakfast
promptly at five so the men could be at work by
five-thirty.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nightmare days followed. Always up at four in
the morning, I was kept constantly at work until
after I had cooked the nine o’clock supper for two
men who made the late trip to town each evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>The house was a large one. There were four children,
the man and his wife, an old aunt and five
hired men besides Dan and myself to cook for. The
laundry had remained undone since the last girl left,
and present opportunities were not to be overlooked.
Such heaps of soiled clothing I never saw before.
Then, when cooking, cleaning, washing and ironing
were done, if perchance there was half an hour to
spare, I was set at the never-ending task of tying
vegetables. On Sunday the mistress of the house
wanted to know whether I could darn stockings, as I
ought to be able to do a good deal of mending on
that day. To cap it all, the couple quarrelled constantly,
nagged the children and one another and
railed at the poor old aunt by the hour. When not
so engaged, the woman would snoop through our
scanty belongings, ask me all manner of personal
questions and follow me about with talk of the good
home she was giving me and how few people there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>were who would take tramps and hoboes right into
their own comfortable houses and care for them.
Poor Dan was driven like a slave from dawn till
dark and after, so at the end of a week, we concluded
to take to the road once more.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Dan informed the man of our intentions
and asked for our money, such a storm of invective
was loosed as is seldom heard. We were lazy, good-for-nothing
bums who were too shiftless to do honest
work, but wanted to live off thrifty, economical
people who had some ambition in life. The woman
declared that I was an ungrateful dog—only she did
not say dog, but referred to the female of the species—that
I had imposed on her hospitality for a whole
week, but she supposed that was all one could expect
for trying to do a good turn to dirty sewer rats.
The man then burst into shocking profanity, which
Dan cut short by suggesting the imminence of a stiff
punch on the jaw.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we were riding away from the “good home,” I
recalled experiences related by servant girls with
whom I had come in contact in the practice of my
profession. I remembered the little maid who was
on duty habitually sixteen hours a day in the mansion
of a San Francisco millionaire. She became
violently insane and was sent to the Napa State Hospital.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>I thought of the great number of household
workers to be found in such institutions, and of the
terrifying increase in insanity. Then my thoughts
turned to those who go astray and others who lead
lives of shame, and the large percentage that are
recruited from the ranks of servant girls. My mind
dwelt on the attitude of friends who counted the
“good home” given a girl a large part of her reward
for service rendered.</p>

<p class='c007'>A good home. What is it? Food and shelter?
Yes. But it is something more. Personal comfort,
the exercise of individual taste in the choice of one’s
intimate surroundings, the joy of ownership, the
privilege of entertaining one’s friends, a sense of
privacy, a certain liberty of habits—all these, added
to that greatest of all great gifts, love, and the
presence of the loved ones, make a true home.</p>

<p class='c009'>We were approaching the Missouri River when
black clouds heaped themselves across the horizon,
and soon blasts of wind and rain forced us to seek
the shelter of a rude shack on the river bank. A
bent, white-bearded man opened the door and invited
us in with all the warmth and grace of real
southern hospitality. There was scant room for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>the wheel beneath the tiny porch, and the two
rooms were already over-crowded.</p>

<p class='c007'>A feeble old lady, swathed in shawls, sat in a
rough box chair at the window. A young girl with
a baby but a few days old on her arm lay on the
bed, while a woman, evidently the daughter of the
old couple, fussed about her. A tall, incredibly
lanky girl was kept busy placing pots and pans to
catch the drippings from the roof, which leaked
in a dozen places.</p>

<p class='c007'>In ten minutes we were chatting as freely as lifelong
friends. The old man was a Confederate veteran,
who had been wrecked financially and physically
by the Civil War. He and his invalid wife had
moved by degrees from Kentucky across Illinois
and Iowa to their present location. One child only
had survived the many privations. She had married
young and been left a widow with two little
girls. The eldest of these, the pale girl in the bed,
had married a youth of eighteen when little more
than a child. The baby which formed the fourth
generation in this home of poverty awakened with
a feeble wail. The mother showed me the wriggling
red mite with an air of pride, but suddenly she
turned her head away and burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Tony, Tony,” she moaned, “how can they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>keep you away from your own beautiful baby boy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Her Tony’s in the jail,” the old man volunteered
with slow bitterness. “In the jail because he
couldn’t see his wife and unborn baby starve. We
had bad luck last winter. I’m an old man. My
right hand never has been worth anything since the
War.” He extended his withered arm, drawn and
distorted by an old wound. “I’ve done all I could,
but work is scarce for such as me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Folks won’t give Grandpap a job. They call him
an old Copperhead.” The younger girl spoke for
the first time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I fought for the South. I love her. Should my
great-grandchild be starved for that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The children had typhoid fever, Tony and Sadie
and Stella.” The quiet, brown-eyed widow took up
the story. “Tony took sick at the camp—he’d only
been there a few weeks—and came home the last of
October ready to die. Sadie took it next. She was
carrying little Tony and it went hard with her. Then
Stella came down. I thought we would lose them
all. We had no money for anything. It was weeks
and weeks before Tony got better and then he wasn’t
strong. I took in washing when the worst was over,
and Pap did all he could. Tony, he’s an orphan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>and Italian besides,—a Dago they call him.” Her
voice trailed off despondently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tony is as good an American as ever lived,”
Sadie spoke up fiercely, “a sight better than the
scrubs around here. Supposing his folks was Italian.
What difference does that make?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tony got work teaming,” the old man spoke
again. “We had no food in the house, the weather
was cold, Sadie was weak from the fever and crying
with hunger all the time. He got to taking
things from the cars and bringing them home. One
time he brought a case of canned soup. How the
girls did go for it. It was their salvation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then one night it was snowing hard. Tony
came in all tuckered out—he never was one of these
husky boys—and he was sitting over the stove, with
Sadie trying to cheer him up. All of a sudden the
door flew open with a bang and in walks a couple of
men—didn’t knock or nothing, just walked in—and
put the handcuffs on him and dragged him away.
I’ll never forget his black eyes, looking so big in
his white face as he stared back at Sadie who had
fallen in a faint.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now he’s in jail, my Tony. He never knew
what it was to have a single soul to love him till
he met me. Just an orphan and a bound boy. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>was always so good to me, working hard for a home
and children. And now he can’t see his own son.
Oh, Tony, Tony!” She flung herself about in
agony.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush, honey, hush. Think of little Tony.
You’ll poison the milk if you take on that away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The frail mother quieted her grief and clasped
her baby in an ecstasy of mother-love. “I must
take good care of you, mother’s little angel. Daddy
will come back to his own little baby boy some
day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The rain had stopped, so we said good-bye to the
unfortunate family and resumed our journey.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is no real poverty in the country districts,
is there now?” I remarked as we pushed the wheel
along the sloppy road.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Tamas knows—he knows,” returned Dan
grimly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old Confederate had told us of another truck
farm not far distant where we could probably find
employment, so we located a convenient clump of
willows and made camp for the night.</p>

<p class='c007'>Early next morning we applied for work at the
farm and were set to the task of weeding onions,
ten hours’ work for a dollar a day and board. Slowly
the hours dragged past. The noon hour found me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>far too weary to eat, so I flung myself face down
under a tree, while Dan sought the cook house with
the other hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once more I began work on the interminable rows.
The sun beat down with intense heat, my back
seemed literally broken. As I weeded in a daze, a
peculiar illusion took possession of my mind. I saw
a cosy room in San Francisco, caught a whiff of
cooling, bracing fog, fresh from the Pacific, heard
the unctuous tones of a well-groomed, fat-jowled,
long-haired gentleman who was declaiming to a
group of adoring females lengthy verses of his own
composition on the “Joy of Labour.” Oh, grave
and paunchy poet, would that thou wert here to busy
thy soft white hands with gummy weeds and thistles
and reap a harvest of joy and onions in my stead!</p>

<p class='c007'>About three o’clock something happened. I found
myself lying under the tree at the side of the field,
with Dan pouring water over my face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the matter, Dan?” I demanded, bewildered
by my new and strange sensations.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, nothing much. You pitched forward on
your head about half an hour ago and I thought you
would never come to. You mark my words now.
This ends it. You don’t do any more weed pulling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>or washing or scrubbing on this trip. If I can’t earn
the living I’ll beg or steal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was my back, dear. I haven’t recovered from
the thump I got that night in the radiator car. As
soon as that spot gets well, I’ll be able to do any
kind of work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may be able, but you won’t do it. I’ll see
to that after this. You lie here and meditate on
what I’ve been telling you while I finish this infernal
day’s work. We’ll beat it into Omaha in the
morning and I’ll look for a white man’s job.” With
a farewell pat he returned to the weeding, leaving
me to fall asleep in utter exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c007'>We trundled over the long bridge across the Missouri
River and passed through Omaha early the
following morning. In a grove of trees on the western
outskirts of the city, Dan pitched camp and
made me as comfortable as possible, then mounted
the wheel and rode into Omaha to search for work.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was stretched full length on the ground, enjoying
the rustle of the wind in the tree tops and the
murmur of a tiny brook, when my attention was
attracted by the sound of footsteps and a moment
later a dainty child in a blue pinafore appeared at
the edge of the little hollow. I smiled a welcome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>and she came closer and leaned against a near-by
tree.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you having a picnic all by yourself?” she
asked, fingering her apron.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, a kind of picnic. I’m all by myself because
my husband has gone to Omaha. You come
over here and sit down by me and then I won’t be
lonesome any more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She approached and snuggled by my side. We
introduced ourselves and soon were deep in an interchange
of confidences. She located various birds’
nests for me, described the latest family of kittens,
discussed the number of eggs laid by her white pullet
and many other matters of interest. Then I
noticed that she seemed uneasy, examining our luggage
with searching glances. Finally, eight-year-old
flesh and blood could endure no more.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is the picnic in that bundle?” she asked wistfully.
“When are you going to eat it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There isn’t very much in that bundle. All I
have is bread and butter, but I’ll get you some of
that,” I replied, sitting up.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her face fell, then brightened. “I know what
I’ll do,” she cried, springing to her feet and clapping
her hands joyously. “I’ll run home and ask mother to
put me up some cookies—and some jam—and some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>hard-boiled eggs—and maybe some animal crackers,
horses, you know, and cows and things—oh, I’ll get
lots and lots of good things to eat, and then I’ll
come back and we’ll have the very nicest picnic ever
you saw in all your life.” She danced away with
fairy-like grace, leaving me to picture her mother’s
expression when informed of the woman who was
holding a picnic all by herself on nothing but bread
and butter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some fifteen minutes passed. Then I heard a gay
“hoo-hoo,” and down the hillside came my girlie,
skipping up and down and hastening the footsteps
of a woman whom I knew at first glance to be her
mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is Ethel, mother,” she cried as I rose to my
feet. Then turning to me, “Now you can’t be lonesome
any more, ’cause mother’s come her own self.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There are persons to whom no introduction is necessary;
we recognise them at once as old friends.
Thus it was with Mrs. Patton and myself. She
was soon in possession of my story and invited me
to her home to rest and spend as many days as circumstances
would permit. I pinned a note for Dan
on the tree trunk, gathered our belongings, and set
off for the house. Hazel piloted us over the ridge,
through orchards and across fields until we came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>to a long, low farmhouse, cuddling between two hills
and almost hidden by masses of vines and trees.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Patton was a trained nurse and at once set
to work to demonstrate her capabilities. She heated
water, gave me a prolonged hot bath, followed by a
thorough spine-stretching and massage, tucked me
into bed, fed me a bountiful lunch, and then left
me to dream away the afternoon in blissful comfort.</p>

<p class='c007'>I awakened about six o’clock, wonderfully relieved
and refreshed and found that my hostess had sent
her son to watch for Dan at the cross roads and
guide him to the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>At dinner we were introduced to Mr. Patton and
John, who were greatly interested in the story of
our adventures. I told them of the old Confederate
soldier, of Sadie grieving for her Tony in the jail,
and they were horrified to learn that such misery
existed so close at hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course, I’ve been aware that there were all
kinds of suffering and wretchedness in the slums of
large cities,” Mr. Patton sighed, “but I thought
there was no real poverty in the country districts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan shot me a covert glance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll get the poor man out of jail, so he can
see his little baby, won’t you, father dear?” Hazel
inquired eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>“Well, well. I’ll see what can be done. It’s a
shame that such conditions should exist in a country
as rich as this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When we had repaired to the living room, Mrs.
Patton suggested music, and upon my delighted
acquiescence, John set the Victrola to playing. Then
for the first time I recognised one cause of my persistent
heart-hunger. My soul was starving for
music. Thrills of ecstasy agitated me almost to
tears as the passionate strains of Tschaikowsky’s
“Melodie” flooded the room with pulsating harmonies.
Raff’s “Cavatina” seemed the divine expression
of universal longing for home and love—<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">heimweh</span></i>
incarnate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once, when we had first moved into Chicago’s
slums, I took my guitar and sang. Simple songs
came to my lips, lullabies, songs of the South, the
old, old songs that caress the heart strings. A noise
at the door startled me. I swung it open and started
back in surprise. Porch, stairway and area below
were packed with children all absorbed in my poor
performance. Many times thereafter I sat at the
narrow entrance and sang while children and adults
crowded about, always asking for more. But at last
the increasing pinch of hunger goaded me into carrying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>the precious guitar, relic of girlhood days, to
the pawnbroker, there to bid it good-bye forever.</p>

<p class='c007'>Millions of acres of land lying barren in the
hands of speculators, hordes of idle men roaming the
country in search of employment, tons of delicious
fruit rotting on the ground in California, hungry
women, billionaires, destitute children, great masses
of wealth producers starving mentally and physically
while the fruits of their labor are denied them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Would to God that the people of this nation could
learn to think!</p>

<p class='c009'>Dan’s efforts to find work in Omaha were unavailing,
so after another day’s rest we struck out on
the military road leading away from the city. Two
days’ travel convinced us that we were hopelessly
wrong.</p>

<p class='c007'>I now look upon myself as something of an expert
in mud, and I can truthfully recommend the Nebraska
article to be superior in cohesion, adhesion, weight
and quantity to any known combination of earth
and water. After a few hundred yards of travel,
the wheels and skirt guard would completely disappear
in great masses of reddish adobe, while our
feet assumed elephantine proportions. Standing first
on one foot, then on the other, we would rid ourselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>of a few pounds of mother earth and scrape
the wheel as free as possible from its accumulations.
A struggle onward of a quarter of a mile forced
us to repeat the process.</p>

<p class='c007'>A day passed—and another. Food ran out and
farmers refused to sell; there were no stores, and
the situation grew desperate.</p>

<p class='c007'>We approached a school house one evening and
stopped under a horse shed for the night. The
teacher was passing and stopped to chat. Later she
returned with a bottle of malted milk tablets, which
constituted our evening meal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next morning we turned south to reach the railroad.
About one o’clock we came to a little blacksmith
shop, and after some haggling, bought a half
loaf of mouldy bread for a dime. Pushing on for
perhaps a mile, we stopped in a lonely spot to make
tea. Everything was dripping with moisture from
recent rains, so, despite Dan’s vigorous efforts, the
fire refused to burn.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were both on our knees blowing lustily when
a shadow falling athwart the rack attracted our
attention and, glancing up, we saw a bareheaded
man standing with folded arms, fixedly regarding us.
We sat back and stared, for we had seen no house
in that vicinity.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>“When you get tired exercising your lungs,” began
the stranger, “just follow me and get a surprise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thinking that any change must be an improvement
on our situation, we gathered up the cooking
utensils and obediently dragged the wheel after our
guide, who plunged into a thick growth of trees on
our right.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few minutes’ walk brought us to an immense
tent, from which issued a great noise of crunching,
stamping and snorting. Passing around to the far
end, we beheld, stretching down one side of the
interior, a long row of horses and mules—perhaps
twenty in number—busily munching their noonday
feed, while the other side of the tent was fitted
with a kitchen range, a gasoline stove, cooking utensils,
table and chairs, and in the rear some bunks
and a great pile of hay. Leading the way through
the kitchen, the stranger pulled out a curtain strung
on a wire, closing off the rear compartment, and
brought a huge kettle of hot water, buckets of cold,
a large tub, towels and soap, with directions to
enjoy ourselves while he prepared a meal. And what
a delight it was to have the use of such conveniences,
crude as they were. My opinion of “dirty hoboes”
has undergone a radical change since I have seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>for myself the difficulties that beset the man who has
nothing, in his efforts toward cleanliness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our ablutions performed, we entered the kitchen
and found our host deep in the labour of cooking.
And what a meal he set out. Hot biscuits, mashed
potatoes, broiled ham and cream gravy, fried eggs
and a pot of delicious coffee.</p>

<p class='c007'>The meal was nearly over before his strange manner
impressed me. Opening a large bread box, he
took the entire contents and going down the row
of animals fed the loaves to them, talking meanwhile
in a most astounding fashion. Returning, he
escorted us to the rear room and insisted on our lying
down, saying that we must be tired, as indeed we
were. The words were scarcely spoken when a heavy
rain beat a tattoo on the tent walls.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Confound this weather,” began our host, settling
himself in a chair; “I’m two-thirds crazy now, and
another three days of this beastly rain will drive me
completely nutty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He held a large contract for road construction,
the grading outfit was his, and “the darned cattle
were eating him out of house and home while he
was sewed up by the weather.” It seemed the
grading crew had gone to Omaha to celebrate their
enforced holiday, but should be back that day.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Reaching under the bed, the boss produced an
empty demijohn and informed us that he had drunk
the contents to cure the blues. He congratulated
himself on our opportune arrival, declaring that he
intended to keep us so long as the rain continued
as an antidote to loneliness and its alcoholic consequences.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just then the smith who had sold us the bread, appeared
on the scene in search of the usual hospitable
stimulant. Our host at once produced another demijohn
and stood treat, imbibing freely himself. While
the two men were thus engaged, a foaming horse,
hitched to a covered buggy, dashed up to the tent
door, and two women followed by a couple of half-drunken
men clambered out. Fishing under the seat,
one fellow drew out four good-sized jugs of
whiskey.</p>

<p class='c007'>Night had fallen and the rain was beating heavily,
but Dan and I exchanged one glance, seized our hats
and made for the wheel, which stood, still packed,
just within the entrance. Hastily we backed it out
and plunged into the stygian darkness. We had
covered a bare hundred feet when wild yells and
shouts for our return showed that our flight was discovered.
The drunken crew came boiling out of
the tent with lanterns in their hands and rushed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>hither and thither. We drew up behind a clump of
bushes and cowered down with our hearts in our
mouths. With an oath, the smith discovered the
track of the wheel in the soft earth and with a howl
of delight started to follow it. Attracted by the
outcry, our erstwhile host lunged madly round the
tent and collided violently with one of the newcomers.
Over and over they rolled in the mud, cursing
and slugging one another in drunken frenzy. The
smith paused within a yard of our hiding place to
watch the battle. The yellow rays of a lantern
cast a circle of light at the tent door and illumined
the struggling forms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cautiously we lifted the wheel, and guarding each
step as best we might, made off in the direction of
the main road. Doggedly we stumbled on, making
as rapid progress as the rain and darkness would
permit, falling at times in the slippery ruts, but
always driving desperately ahead.</p>

<p class='c007'>After what seemed an eternity, a light shone off
to the left. Following a private road, we came to
a gate. The shrill bark of a dog sounded from an
outbuilding. I opened the gate and entered. A cold
nose touched my hand and I felt the pressure of another
against my skirt. I have no fear of dogs and
have never been bitten, but Dan is not so fortunate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>so he remained in the background while I explored
the premises. Accompanied by the dogs, I marched
boldly to the front door of a large house and rang
the bell. It was opened by a man who stared at my
dripping figure in amazement. His eyes travelled
from me to the dogs, a Great Dane and an Airedale,
and I realised the full significance of his glance. I
explained the situation and asked leave to sleep in
his barn.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” he answered uncertainly, “as a rule, I
never let anybody sleep in my outbuildings, but a
person who can get past those dogs must be all right,
so wait till I get a lantern and I’ll take you and
your husband over to the hay mow and make you as
comfortable as I can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He turned into the house and soon came out with
a lantern and an armful of bedding beneath an oilskin.
Calling Dan and quieting the dogs, he conducted
us to a large barn where we were soon settled
for the night and glad enough to be under the
shelter of a safe roof.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was awakened this morning by the romping of
two kittens and the fox terrier I heard barking last
night. The sun is shining brightly and everything
looks fresh and clean after the storm. The farmer
showed us where to build a fire with dry corn cobs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>and supplied us with a brimming pan of new milk,
a basket of eggs and a crusty loaf of fresh, homemade
bread, for all of which he refused compensation.</p>

<p class='c007'>While waiting for our things to dry, the day after
the experience in the grader’s camp, we visited our
host and his family, who were shocked at the dangers
we had encountered unarmed. The eldest son
brought out a sharp lath hatchet, through the handle
of which a hole had been bored and a stout leather
loop attached to slip over the hand. This he handed
to Dan with the remark that while it could hardly be
called a deadly weapon, it would do good execution
in case of trouble and at the same time be useful in
making camp. Little did I think, as Dan thanked
him heartily and strapped it on the wheel, how soon
that hatchet would prove the means of saving my
life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later in the day we reached the railroad and
that night camped in a ravine. The next day dawned
hot and clear. Mile after mile we trudged down
the track, for the roads were still too wet for riding.
Houses were scarce and stood far away from our
course; there were no streams near or other places
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>to obtain drinking water. Our thirst increased as
the day wore on, and when at last we saw a farmhouse
in a group of trees some half mile from the
track, Dan suggested that I remain with the bicycle
while he crossed the several pastures that lay between
and brought back a kettle of water. So I sat beside
the wheel on the edge of the embankment while Dan
climbed the fence and disappeared in the trees.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a few minutes a dreadful commotion arose from
the direction of the farmhouse. A great, roaring
voice was booming like a cannon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get out!&nbsp;... ornery hide. You....” Inarticulate
outcries and oaths mingled with scattered
words and phrases.</p>

<p class='c007'>I listened appalled. I knew the attitude that
some farmers maintained towards tramps, and I
trembled for Dan’s safety. The racket increased in
violence. I became frantic and determined to go
to the rescue. Unstrapping the hatchet from the
handle bars, I slipped the thong about my wrist and
plunged under the railroad fence and across the
field, determined to take a short cut to the scene
of combat. Worming a difficult passage through a
barbed wire fence, I came to a black, sluggish creek
or strip of mud perhaps eight feet wide, bordered
by a thick row of trees, whose branches hung low
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>over the surface. An extremely stout barbed wire
fence stretched at right angles across this stream and
joined a similar fence on the farther bank. I paused
on the brink, for the black, slimy surface was repellent.
The outcries redoubled and from where I stood
whole sentences became intelligible.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on now, you&nbsp;... son of a gun! Get out
of that gate, you. Oh, if I could only reach you
with a club. I’ll shoot your hide full of holes in
about a minute.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I gazed anxiously up and down. My only course
was to wade across. Grasping the hatchet firmly, I
swung my arms, made a little run, a jump and
plunged in. Down, down I sank, deeper and deeper.
I laboured furiously to reach the further bank, but
my struggles only increased the rapidity with which
I sank. The thick, black slime rose higher and
higher about me. I tried to scream, but my parched
lips could utter no sound. We have no quicksands or
sloughs in my home country, but I have read of
such places and heard of horses and cattle and sometimes
human beings going down, never to be seen
again. I thought of Dan escaping from the farmer
and returning to find the abandoned wheel. Of his
wife, there would be no trace. My end would always
remain a mystery. As the black mud sucked me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>down, I could imagine it rising to my chin, my lips,
my nostrils. I could picture the inky surface closing
over my head, shutting out the sunlight forever.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a frenzy, I threw my arms above my head.
The blade of the hatchet caught over a bough. Cautiously
I pulled. It held firm. A gleam of hope
illumined my dark despair. Grasping the handle
with my left hand, I tried to lift myself out, but
the slough refused to give up its victim so easily.
The blade slipped a little. My heart seemed to leap
from my body. My senses reeled. Fiercely I called
on all my forces of reason, will and self-control.</p>

<p class='c007'>Placing just enough weight on the hatchet handle
to prevent my sinking deeper, I studied the situation
calmly. My one hope lay in securing a firm hold on
the large branch above.</p>

<p class='c007'>Little by little I began to spring the smaller shoot
up and down. Harder and harder I pulled on the
hatchet, at the same time forcing the blade firmly
over the limb. The leaves swung closer and closer.
Emboldened, I worked harder than ever. At last I
was able to abandon my hold on the hatchet and
secure a firm grip with both hands on the tough
wood.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the slough dragged me down with a grip like
an octopus. A ton weight pulled at each foot, my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>skirt seemed grasped by a thousand clutching hands.
And then I gave thanks for my broad shoulders, and
for the violent exercise of steering the tandem, which
had developed the sturdy muscles of my hands and
arms. Slowly, slowly I made headway against the
treacherous depths; slowly, slowly, the vicious grip
was broken, till with a gasp of relief I dragged myself
out upon the bank.</p>

<p class='c007'>I sank down exhausted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then from the farmhouse the undiminished sounds
of conflict forced themselves into my consciousness
and suddenly I burned with a reckless berserk rage
against the whole world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Springing to my feet, I hurled myself upon the
barbed wire fence that crossed the slough, and clinging
with hands and feet to the thorny strands, edged
my way across. Skirt and stockings were torn in
a dozen places. My heavy coils of hair slipped
down. My hands bled profusely. Forcing my way
through the second fence, I started across the meadow.
As I rounded a clump of bushes a large red
bull, with head to ground and pawing hoof,
barred my way. But I was far past caring for such
as he.</p>

<p class='c007'>Snatching up a stick, I began clapping wood and
hatchet together and charged directly at his lordship.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>He stood his ground till the hatchet was almost
touching his nose, then, with a bellow of fear, turned
tail and raced across the field with me in close pursuit.
Gaining the fence, I tumbled over and arrived
panting at the back of the farmhouse.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a beautiful kitchen garden a farmer stood as
though rooted to the ground with amazement at
my grotesque appearance, as with hands and face
streaked with blood, clothing in shreds and bedraggled
with mud, I stood before him with a club in
one hand and a hatchet in the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>Eyes bulging, nostrils flaming, tail in air, a fine
bull calf was careering madly among the vegetables.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wh—wh—why, my good Lord, woman,” began
the man as he recovered his breath. “What’s happened
to you? Where in the world did you drop
from?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is my husband? What have you done
to him?” I demanded hotly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, now. Let me see.” He scratched his head
perplexedly. “Seems like I recall a man askin’ for
a bucket o’ water something like a half hour back.
Might he be your man now? I was so plum frantic
with this here pesky calf, that I didn’t pay no attention
to the man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But who were you going to shoot?” I persisted.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“I could hear you swearing clear over to the railroad.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sho, now. Is that so? ’Scuse me. I’m plum
bad about swearin’. Wife, she’s after me all the
time, too,” he apologised. “Now, the wife’s right
set on her posies, and this here —— calf—’scuse
me, seems like I just can’t stop cussin’—got in and
trompled ’em all down, and while I was a trying
my darndest to get him out, I’ll be damned if he
didn’t bust through into the vegetables and cavort
all over them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile, the innocent cause of the commotion
had taken advantage of the lull in the storm to make
his escape from the garden.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You didn’t get in the slough, did ye?” continued
the farmer, eyeing my skirt. “Didn’t ye see all them
fences? We had so much trouble with the stock
gettin’ in the —— hole—’scuse me, beats the devil
how those words will come apopping out—that
we fenced her all in. But what gets me is how
ye come to get past that bull ’thout being gored to
death. He’s turrible dangerous. That’s why we
got all them high fences about. Kill’t two men, he
did, ’fore I got him. Bought him cheap, but the
wife just raises a hell of a row—’scuse me—at
keepin’ him.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>I asked for water, for my thirst was intense, and
after drinking deep from the dripping dipper and
washing off the worst of the blood and dirt, I followed
the farmer to the main road, where he pointed
out a short cut to the railroad.</p>

<p class='c007'>There I found Dan rushing frantically about, for
having found the wheel with the hatchet gone, he
felt sure I had been kidnapped.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems that he had gone to the house, found the
farmer chasing the calf, secured the water, then
thinking it would be difficult to carry the kettle
through the fences, tried another route and got on
the wrong road. Before he could find the right path
and return, I was in the slough.</p>

<p class='c007'>We slept that night in a tumble-down shed—or
rather, Dan did. Each time I dropped to sleep, I
could feel myself sinking in the slough, and would
wake up with a start.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next day we rode a good deal and covered a long
stretch of territory. The country was flat and uninteresting
and my strained muscles occupied most
of my attention as I tried to confine the rebellious
wheel to the smoother stretches.</p>

<p class='c007'>At noon we pitched camp near the railroad track
and had the meal well under way when a passenger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>train pulled out of a station a mile or two ahead
and thundered toward us.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look,” exclaimed Dan. “What’s the matter
there? The train is going to stop.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sure enough, it was losing speed. People were
thrusting their heads from windows while the fireman
was looking back at a group of men on the blind
end of the baggage car. Just as it ranged alongside
us, a small figure catapulted from the platform and
rolled almost to our feet. The train gathered way
and sped on.</p>

<p class='c007'>I rushed forward and fell on my knees beside a
grimy, tattered boy of some twelve years, who was
clutching his fiery red head in both hands and cursing
like a pirate. Blood was spurting from a deep
jagged gash in his left wrist, which he had struck
against the projecting fragment of a broken bottle
in his descent. I seized his arm and applied pressure
to control the hemorrhage. He fixed me with
an uncomprehending glare. Then his eyes fell on his
dripping arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Lord,” he gasped, “oh, Lord, I’m bleedin’
to death—I’m goin’ to die. Oh, Ma, Ma.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nonsense, kid, you won’t die. That blood looks
a lot worse than it is. Just be a good boy and hold
still for a few minutes and I’ll fix you all safe.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Quick, Dan. Hand me that kettle of boiling water.
Now, unpack my emergency case.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By the time Dan had the kit unpacked and contents
laid out the water had cooled enough for use.
I cleansed and sterilised the wound, tied the artery,
and soon had the arm bandaged in scientific fashion.
The boy had made no sound, but gazed in fascination
at the shining little instruments, the vials of
antiseptics and rolls of gauze.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see, this case proved useful after all,” I
remarked to Dan as I gathered up the implements.
“If such things are needed at all, they usually are
needed badly. This boy would have bled to death
without proper attention.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At my words the lad burst into tears. “The —— sons
of ——” he sobbed. “They all jumped me at
once. They wouldn’t let me alone. I wasn’t doin’
no harm. It—it don’t cost the old railroad nothin’
if I do ride the blind. I want to go home. I want
to go ho—ome.” Tears washed pallid channels
down his sooty cheeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you think you can take a little nourishment,
young man?” queried Dan as he busied himself with
the meal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The boy checked his sobs. “I dunno what that
is, but I kin eat any old kind of chuck. You just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>try me once and I’ll show you. I ain’t had nothin’
but one little old hunk of bread in two days.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, take this pan of water and see if you can
remove some of that make-up from your manly countenance
and then pitch into the grub. I’ll die of
starvation myself if I don’t eat soon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I set another kettle of water to boil for tea, and we
all fell to with avidity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, I made good time last night,” the boy
volunteered, as he finished his third helping of
canned beans and bread. “Rode the Overland Limited.
Gee whiz, but she does burn up the rails. If
I only could a stuck, I’d been home to-morrow. But
those boneheads chucked me off this morning. Then
I landed that old hearse they thrown me off of just
now. Suppose I’ll have to hoof it till night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why don’t you catch a freight? You wouldn’t
be nearly so likely to get into trouble.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Huh, a freight! Me? Not on your life! What
do you think I am, a dead one? I’m a live guy, I
am. No bundle stiff about me. Say, do you know,
I’ve beat it clear from northern Wyoming. I’ve
been workin’ a long time there as a cowboy on a
great big cattle ranch. Say, that’s the life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Seems to me you’re travelling in the wrong direction
for a cowboy,” I observed. “The cattle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>ranges all lie west of here, and you’re heading east.
How does that happen?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you see, Ma she wants to see me, so I
thought I’d make a short trip home. Me and the
old man had a falling out, and I beat it west. Say,
do you know, he expected me to milk two cows, milk
’em and feed ’em and wait on ’em hand and foot.
No fun nor nothin’. And weed the garden! Say, I
bet you never saw as big a garden as we got—great
long rows—and say, I bet you never saw weeds grow
as fast as ours do—big, tall weeds. But Ma wants
to see me, so I gotta go home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did your mother write to you to come?” I enquired
gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, she didn’t write. I’ve never stayed very
long in one place so I never wrote to tell her where
I was.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, my! She must be terribly worried about
you. How long have you been away?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, let’s see—it must be nearly six weeks now
since I beat it. I met a gang of hoboes the first
day I was out and they took me right along with
’em to northern Wyoming. Say, that’s a great country,
all right, all right. But, of course, when Ma
wanted to see me I had to leave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I tell you where’s a bad town you gotta fight shy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>of. That’s little old Cheyenne. There’s a gun man
there, Jeff Farr’s his name. Say, he shoots a Bo for
breakfast every mornin’. You folks want to watch
out when you go through. They run you in for nothin’
at all. I met a nigger just the other side o’ there.
Say, he was runnin’ in circles like a fitty cat. They
had chucked his pal in the can just for nothin’ at
all—vag charge maybe—and no tellin’ when he’d
get out, and here’s this poor coon, can’t go off and
leave his pard, can’t find work, can’t get nothin’ to
eat, can’t do a thing in the world but chase around
and bawl. Say, I felt awful sorry for that poor
coon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We raided our scanty stores to pack a lunch for
the boy. I instructed him in the care of his wound,
described the location of various houses along the
road where I knew by experience he would be sure
to find help, gave him a little note of recommendation
and explanation to use when applying for assistance,
then started him on the way to his waiting
mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just at sundown we came to the town of Wood
River, a place I am destined to remember. Storm
clouds were piling on the horizon as Dan hurried to
the shop to buy some meat for supper. While he
was gone, some Greeks approached and with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>much gesticulation endeavoured to explain something
to me. I gathered an idea of trouble of some
kind, but exactly what they were driving at I was
unable to determine.</p>

<p class='c007'>We camped on the outskirts of the village, and
had hardly finished our simple meal when gusts of
wind and great drops of rain proclaimed the coming
of the storm. We looked anxiously about for shelter.
There were no barns near, but not far from
the railroad track stood a house in process of construction,
and while doors and windows were lacking,
the roof and outside walls gave promise of
sufficient protection. To this we hurried and lifted
the wheel onto the veranda just as a flood of rain
burst upon us. After a little search we found some
nail kegs and sat down in the front room. We
were dozing when footsteps sounded on the porch.
I strained my eyes, but could see nothing in the
pitchy blackness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly a light flashed in my face, the cold muzzle
of a pistol pressed my temple, and a hand gripped
my arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get up there. None of your tricks now,” snarled
a harsh voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The flash was turned on Dan, who was ordered to
throw up his hands by a second man, who flourished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>a revolver in his left hand. We stumbled to our
feet, dazed by the unexpectedness of it all.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re under arrest. Better come quietly,”
growled the first man gruffly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan tried to explain that we had only taken shelter
from the storm and had no intention of doing
any damage, but was savagely ordered to shut up.
Grasping me tightly by the arm, the first fellow led
the way out of the building and down the road to
the village.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arrived at a tiny, wooden shanty, the man unlocked
the door and crowded us in. They slammed
and bolted the door behind us and we heard their
footsteps retreating up the walk. As we stood, too
bewildered to move, a match flared in the darkness
and in a moment the feeble rays of a candle revealed
the interior of the lock-up. It consisted of
a single room, partially divided by a partition, and
containing two bunks. On one of these sprawled a
man, while a big negro held aloft the guttering candle
end. At sight of a woman the recumbent man
sprang to his feet and courteously bade us good
evening. Without further ado or questioning, he
removed his hat and coat from the bunk where he
had been lying and suggested that we make ourselves
as comfortable as circumstances would permit.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>At once the negro blew out the candle with the
remark that we might need it before morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we settled ourselves as best we might in the
darkness, flashes of lightning revealed the dimensions
of the one small, barred window, which furnished
all ventilation to the unfortunates within.
Furniture, drinking water or conveniences were utterly
lacking and my flesh crawled at the thought
of the straw-covered bunk on which we must rest in
the confined space.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hardly had we lain down, when the door was
opened and a fifth person was hustled in. Again
the negro lit his candle stub, and we saw that the
newcomer was a boy of not more than sixteen years.</p>

<p class='c007'>The officers had paused just outside the window
and one remarked that it was time to go home. There
were no occupied buildings near the jail and I could
not help but consider what our fate would be should
lightning strike the flimsy wooden shack or a fire
start from match or candle. When I realised that I
was locked within those constricting walls, it seemed
that they were crowding in and smothering me. I
wanted to scream, to beat my hands against the bars,
but reason forbade. I settled down and strove to
cultivate the non-resisting attitude of our cell mates,
but my mind kept busy with the wonders of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>boasted American civilisation that permits such occurrences
as this. I thought of the churches throughout
the land—no doubt there was one in this very
community—and of the teachings of One who had
no place to lay His head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was a stranger and ye took me not in&nbsp;... sick,
and in prison and ye visited me not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>How many of the good people of the nation have
ever even so much as thought of visiting those cast
into their barbaric prisons?</p>

<p class='c007'>At sunrise our jailers returned, unlocked the door
and set us free. There was no charge against us
and no legal formalities to go through apparently.
Retrieving the wheel, we hastened out of town.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beside a small house some miles away we stopped
to get water for breakfast. A motherly woman came
to talk to us. Hearing of our recent experiences,
she took us into her home, provided us with hot
baths, and sent us to bed while she cleaned and
sterilised our contaminated apparel. Completely
exhausted, I slept the clock around and woke next
morning to find my clothing, clean and neatly mended,
piled on a chair at the bedside. So, thanks
to our good Samaritan, we are able to go forward
with renewed strength and courage.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The days go by as in a dream. We seldom see a
newspaper and seem out of touch with the world.
At night I am too thoroughly occupied with my blistered
feet or else too busy “spouting for the eats,”
as Dan expresses it, to keep track of diary or calendar.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Spouting for the eats” has come to be quite a
joke with us. We stop near some farmhouse and
Dan goes in for water. Presently along come the
kids and watch our camp preparations with much
interest. Usually they are followed by father or
mother, or, perchance, a grown son, who at once becomes
absorbed in the tale of our adventures. Soon
the whole family may be seen crouched around our
little fire, which illuminates the eager faces as they
drink in every word with ears and mouth and eyes.
Dan fumbles about with the camp kettle and I break
off in the middle of some exciting incident to attend
to the preparations for supper. Somebody wakes up
to the need for milk and eggs, which, of course, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>difficult to carry with us. It is usually about milking
time, and at a word from some grown-up a child
scurries off and proudly returns with a pail of new
milk and a hatful of eggs, which he shyly presents
to me. The eggs are boiled and eaten from the
shell, and the cocoa made from undiluted new milk
is a beverage fit for the gods.</p>

<p class='c007'>In other instances, we are invited into the house
and sit down to a real country supper. After the
meal I resume the interrupted narrative and entertain
our hosts with descriptions of life in Chicago,
the San Francisco earthquake, and incidents of interest
along the way. Quite frequently I advise a
change of diet and care for some puny infant, or
diagnose the case of an ailing mother and risk the
leaving of a prescription to be filled when we are
well on our journey.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next morning the family assembles to see us start.
We exchange names and addresses, and as we ride
away, we feel that a new bond of friendship has
been established.</p>

<p class='c007'>Near a little place called Gibbon our rear tire
gave out, and while making the change, a farmer
invited us to his home to eat supper and spend the
night. After considerable trouble with the wheel,
we started on shortly after noon next day, but had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>not gone far when we saw dense, black clouds piling
up ahead. We rode hard for some time, then rain
began to fall and we stopped beneath a cattle shed.
The rain slackened and we rode on, but had not
proceeded any great distance when we noticed a
very severe storm raging in the northwest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon great gusts of wind came whirling across
the prairie, while rain and sleet whipped our faces.
There was no shelter near, so we determined to struggle
on and reach Kearney if possible. A train
steamed past, with passengers leaning from the windows
and waving their arms in great excitement.
Glancing about to learn the cause of the commotion,
I looked toward the south and nearly fell from
the wheel. A cyclone was bounding across the country
and as I gazed it whirled a building into the air,
then dashed it to earth, where it flew into a thousand
fragments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly we were picked up, wheel and all, and
the next thing I knew, were rolling over and over
in the ditch at the roadside, while the tandem lay
twenty feet away. As I struggled to my feet I saw
another cyclone, which had just given us a playful
flip, scudding away in the north. Hailstones as
large as pigeon’s eggs now began to pelt us, and to
add to our discomfort, we found that both chains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>and the steering gear had been broken in the crash
and Kearney was still at least two miles distant.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had pushed the damaged bicycle a scant hundred
yards when a two-seated automobile, guided by
a man with a white-faced woman at his side, drew
up beside us. The man invited me to ride into
Kearney with him while Dan brought in the wheel.
Dan urged me into the back seat and the machine
plunged ahead. With a wild yell, the driver whipped
off his soft felt hat and began to beat the steering
wheel with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whoop-la!” he howled. “Go it, Nellie! Go it,
old girl! Show the natives what you can do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The car careened from side to side across the wet
and slippery road. At tremendous speed we struck
the railroad crossing at a tangent. Tossing us high
in the air, the machine leaped for the ditch. With
a powerful wrench the driver whirled the car, which
poised on two wheels at the verge, then headed
straight for a telegraph pole on the other side of the
road. Once more he veered, and the brass hub of the
hind wheel bit into the wood as we shot past.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Providence was with us, and in a few moments
the car drew up in front of a hotel in Kearney,
while the half-drunken owner staggered out and, conducting
me within, engaged and paid for the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>room in the house for Dan and me. The other poor
woman, who had been picked up from the roadside
like myself, made her escape.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan came in, drenched and weary from the buffeting
of the storm, and threw himself on the bed.
I heard a terrific, roaring, crashing, rending sound,
and rushing to the window saw another cyclone
sweeping through the outskirts of the town. Large
trees swayed and whipped madly, then were whirled
into the air.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cyclone! Cyclone! Quick, Dan, here comes
another cyclone,” I screamed above the roar of the
tempest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Darn the cyclone,” Dan replied; “I’ve seen
enough for one day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, he came to the window just as the
great, black, swirling funnel passed from view, and,
gazing at the sky, enquired where all the books had
come from. Sure enough, something floated in the
heavens that resembled the scattered leaves of volumes.
An instant later these pages came down and
disclosed themselves as the sides and roofs of houses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next morning Dan took the wheel to the repair
shop while I studied the ravages of the storm. No
lives were lost in that immediate neighbourhood,
but much property had been destroyed. The brick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>foundation of one home had been scattered in every
direction, while the wooden frame, apparently unharmed,
had been set down on its original site. In
another instance a parlour wall had been neatly removed
and a marriage license torn from the frame
which still hung in its place, while furniture and
pictures remained untouched. This peculiar phenomenon
gave rise to considerable comment and
jokes concerning the domestic felicity of the married
pair.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were eating our lunch in a vacant lot when our
friend from Gibbon drove up. He called Dan over
for a short talk, then drove rapidly away. When
Dan returned and held out his palm, I cried out in
surprise, for in his hand lay four shining five dollar
gold pieces. When we had gone and the storm
came up, this man had worried over our probable
fate, and early next morning had driven the twelve
miles into Kearney to overtake and give us this
money to ease the journey across the Rockies. Thus
we were able to renew our shoes and stockings, which
were in shreds, pay for new parts for the wheel, lay
in a stock of groceries and still have a little money
in our pockets.</p>

<p class='c007'>If grateful, loving thoughts have power to benefit
the recipient, then surely our benefactor will receive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>some reward, for my whole soul pours itself out in
deepest gratitude for his gracious, generous act.</p>

<p class='c009'>Leaving Kearney, we were able to do a good deal
of riding, but suffered severely from heat in the middle
of the day. For miles we rode beside stock
fences where groups of horses with heads tossing,
nostrils flaming, manes and tails floating like pennons
in a breeze, raced beside us to the confines
of their pastures, there to stand with stamping hoofs
and outstretched noses, eyeing us with the greatest
curiosity. Once a steer, grazing by the roadside,
started to run ahead of us, and lumbered along a
full mile, then, in a panic of fear, he reared and
up-ended over the fence in a comical fashion and
stood blowing wildly, watching his strange pursuer
glide past.</p>

<p class='c007'>The road became wretchedly poor. Again and
again the wheel would slip into the deep ruts filled
with choking dust in spite of every effort. In places
where the surface was hard, innumerable small gullies
from the winter rains crossed at right angles, so
that riding became unsafe from the strain on the
heavily-laden tandem.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mosquitoes bred in the sluggish streams, full-fed
by recent storms, and when evening fell surrounded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>us in dense clouds. Their bites are almost as painful
to me as bee stings, raising great, red wheals,
which itch and burn for days, so that I was nearly
wild from the irritation. To add to the general discomfort,
my new shoes, which were very heavy for
the coming trip across the desert, blistered my feet
atrociously, so that when the rear chain broke in
crossing a bad gully, I was scarcely able to hobble.</p>

<p class='c007'>And each succeeding day made greater demands
on one’s endurance. The country became hilly with
stretches of treacherous sand. High bench lands,
seamed with narrow ravines, skirted rugged buttes,
while to the south and west one caught vistas of
barren plains. Small farmhouses perched on the
hillsides, and here and there great fields of grain or
sprouting corn appeared, with groups of animals
grazing in the distance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan had managed to mend the damaged chain,
but his natural recklessness chafed constantly against
my caution, so that each steep descent provoked an
argument. At last I flung discretion to the winds
and down the hills we flew, bounding from hummock
to hummock, swaying, lurching, recovering ourselves
by seeming miracles.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had been riding across a jutting arm of bench
land, and as we approached a sharp turn in the road,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>the ground began to fall away abruptly. I endeavoured
to slow down, but Dan was of a different
mind. Spurred on by his words of ridicule, I permitted
the wheel to gain momentum and we spun
around the curve at racing speed.</p>

<p class='c007'>A tremendously long and steep declivity lay before
us, the strip of road disappearing from our
sight in another turn at the bottom of a ravine. My
heart leaped convulsively as the wind whistled past
my ears, but I had scant time to coddle fear. The
strain of handling the heavy tandem at such a speed
took all my attention. The pitch increased; we
seemed to fly through space. Then the front wheel
struck a bed of heavy sand at the curve, and I knew
no more.</p>

<p class='c007'>My next sensation was of a shaking, joggling motion
and by degrees I discovered that I was lying on
my back on the bottom of a farm wagon that was
jolting slowly up a rutty hillside. Dan, very pale,
was bending over me, and the wheel with twisted
handle bars and dangling chain was propped
alongside. In answer to his anxious inquiries, I undertook
a few investigative movements and soon was
able to assure him that I suffered from nothing
worse than some severe bruises and slight concussion
from alighting on my head. He had received a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>rather deep scratch in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</span></i>, but otherwise was
uninjured.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wagon turned abruptly and I struggled to a
sitting posture, as our driver, a lad of some sixteen
summers, halted his team of mules in front of a
low, unpainted farmhouse. A motherly woman hurried
out in answer to his call, and in a moment was
all solicitude. With tender care she guided my
reeling footsteps into the house and I was soon
ensconced on the living room lounge while Dan occupied
a rocker at my side. After seeing that we
were both as comfortable as circumstances would
permit, our hostess left the room to prepare supper.</p>

<p class='c007'>The outer door swung open and a handsome, blue-eyed
boy about twelve years old, dressed from head
to foot in blue denim, passed slowly through the
room and, with a shy nod to us, entered the kitchen.
Scarcely ten seconds later the same door opened
and the boy again appeared and with another little
duck of the head disappeared in the rear. I
was marvelling at the speed he had shown in
encircling the house in such a short time, when
the sound of the latch caught my ear and I
turned to confront the same blue-clad figure.
But was it the same? No, this lad was larger.
It must be a brother. He also passed through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>and vanished with the peculiar sideways nod.
Almost before I could wink an eye, his double
followed, using the identical gesture of his predecessors.
I turned to Dan, who was staring round-eyed
after the vanishing figure. Just as I opened my
mouth to address him, the door opened and a fifth
youth appeared. He too was blue-eyed, blue-clad
and strikingly good to look upon. Dan rubbed his
eyes; then ran his hand through his thick curls.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That jolt must have done something to my
brain,” he declared with a worried look at me. “Do
you see whole droves of kids, all looking the same,
all dressed the same, all acting the same, all going
from the front to the back of the house? First I
thought a kid was running round the house to fool
us. Then I thought I was seeing double, but they
keep getting bigger all the time, till darned if I know
what to think. What in blazes do you suppose
is the matter with me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s as much a mystery to me as it is to you,” I
replied. “Whatever it is, it affects us both the same
way, for I saw them just as you did. There were
five, all dressed in blue, all with blue eyes and light
hair, and about the same size, though the first
seemed the smallest and the last the largest. At first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>I thought they were twins, but there could scarcely
be five twins.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At that instant the boy who had rescued us from
the roadside appeared, and as he advanced to speak
to us, another lad, a size larger, entered from the
kitchen and was joined in a moment by boys number
one, two, three and four. The room was of fair
size, but it seemed to overflow with blue-clad youths.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what do you think of my little brood?”
cried the laughing voice of our hostess, who had
entered unobserved.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are these all your boys?” I gasped, gazing at
her still youthful face and figure. “It doesn’t seem
possible. I had about concluded that the fall from
the bicycle had affected my brain or my vision; I
wasn’t sure which.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed, they are all mine, and not all my family
either. My two oldest sons are still in the fields.
I have nine in all. The eldest has just turned twenty-three,
while the youngest two are twelve. The
next two are twins also, and only fifteen months
older.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As the lads were introduced, it seemed that a more
remarkable, handsomer group of youngsters would
be difficult to find. In spite of the utmost care, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>was unable to identify the younger ones, so that they
must linger in my memory as a group.</p>

<p class='c007'>All were eager to be of service and assisted Dan
in putting the tandem in shape for further adventures.
It was with regret that we bade them farewell
next morning, and I often think with envy of
the happy mother of such a delightful family.</p>

<p class='c007'>One evening we stood beside the railroad track
while the Overland Limited shot by. As we crossed
behind the vanishing train, I saw a strange object
moving between the rails. Closer inspection disclosed
a large terrapin crawling over the ties as fast
as he could scramble. I gathered him up and took
him back to Dan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now for some real turtle soup,” cried he, making
a grab for the creature. But the terrapin resented
such tactics with so fierce a snap that Dan, perforce,
released him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sitting beside the campfire that evening, I bored
a hole in Mister Turtle’s shell and attached a stout
string. Next morning we rigged a large square can
atop the bedding roll and daily the turtle rode in
state on a bed of fresh leaves, while at night he was
staked out in whatever water was available. He
attracted much attention along the way, for his shell
was very handsome, but his jaws proved to be so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>savage that nobody dared to touch him but me. I
named him Bird and, while resting, would frequently
take him from his bed and gently stroke
and tickle his neck or leg, which he would stretch
out to be petted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some time later we camped on the bank of the
North Platte River and as usual I staked Bird out
at the edge of the stream. Next morning I was
busy with the laundry, so did not call for Mister
Turtle until nearly noon. What was my amazement
to find him flat on his back at the extreme limit
of his string, while a large bird stalked round and
round him and aimed vicious pecks at the soft folds
of skin between the edges of his shell. I rescued my
poor pet, who seemed completely exhausted, and,
conscience-stricken, loosed the string and gave him
his liberty. A last glance revealed Bird paddling
down stream. He will surely be a well-travelled turtle
by the time he reaches the sunny south for which
he so boldly headed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The scene on the river seemed very charming after
our hot and dusty ride across the arid plain. Masses
of wild roses in full bloom glowed against the soft
green background of willows. Birds had woven a
hanging nest over the water, and the little mother
sat demurely on the eggs, while her mate swung on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>a slender perch and fairly burst his throat with song.
They reminded me of some wrens a few miles back
who had built their nest in an abandoned mailbox,
but I suppose they could scarcely belong to the same
species. In the rippling water beneath, fish of many
sizes darted to and fro, while a fitful breeze set the
silvery foliage to glimmering.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reluctantly we said farewell to river and birds
and roses and, skimming over a long bridge, entered
a sleepy little town. Here we loaded the wheel to
the limit with groceries, for the country grew wilder
each day.</p>

<p class='c007'>The weather was fine and we were able to camp
out in accordance with our original plans. Still, we
thought it best to follow the railroad as closely as
possible in the event of more rain and muddy roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>While boiling our cocoa in a lonely spot, our attention
was attracted by the fine soldierly figure of
a man who stood on the railroad embankment about
fifty feet away, gazing down at us. He was dressed
in khaki, sombrero, and leggings, and seemed preternaturally
tall, silhouetted on the dull red evening
sky.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello, comrade,” called Dan. “Want a bite to
eat?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The man strode down the bank and approached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>our fire. He was tall indeed, with the slim waist
and long limbs of a track athlete. His smooth, deeply-tanned
skin set off his bright blue eyes and white
teeth to advantage as a real Tipperary smile curved
his humorous lips. As he removed his hat, a
thatch of white hair added an incongruous touch
to his appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Squatting on his haunches like one accustomed to
that posture, he explained that he had just eaten a
hearty meal, but accepted a cup of cocoa to keep
us company. After listening to an account of our
experiences, he stated that he was an ex-soldier, now
walking from San Francisco to New York on a
wager. He had made the trip from east to west in
ninety days and was bent on returning in ten weeks.
So far he had made good time and felt confident of
winning. With scant regard for the property of the
railroad company, he insisted on carrying a great pile
of old ties to a secluded spot and there started a
bonfire. When I considered the forty-odd miles that
he had covered on foot that day, I marvelled at the
man. When the fire was blazing brightly, we settled
ourselves on the windward side for a real talk-feast.</p>

<p class='c007'>His most exciting adventure on this trip had occurred
far out on the desert when he had been accosted
by three tramps, who demanded the canteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>of water that he carried on his shoulder. He unslung
it with the intention of sharing the precious
fluid, but one attempted to snatch it from his hand.
As they struggled, another approached and struck
him from the rear with a rock. With a sudden sidelong
leap, he wrenched himself free, and swinging
the canteen by the strap with all his force, let the
first man have it full in the forehead. The fellow
went down without a groan, and with a backhand
motion, the soldier brought the canteen up and
around, striking the second tramp on the point of
the jaw. His companions out of commission, the
third man took to his heels, while our hero gathered
up the first hobo, who still lay unconscious, and
with the aid of the second carried him to the railroad
track and there flagged a passing freight, which
took the two tramps to the next town.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the evening advanced, the Irishman entertained
us with descriptions of the many strange corners of
the world that he had visited in the service of Uncle
Sam, and told wild yarns of his experiences in the
Philippines and in China during the Boxer rebellion.
After a last creepy story of a looted temple
and a dead Chinese priest, who came to life while
the foreign devils were holding high carnival, and
walking into their midst in his grave clothes, caused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>them to drop their spoils and flee, we stretched ourselves
beside the glowing coals and slept.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sharp cold of early morning awakened me,
and heaping the ashes high with dry wood, I kindled
a fire and started breakfast. Our soldier friend lay
with head on knapsack, and in the deep relaxation
of sleep the harsh footprints of the years disappeared
and his face looked pure and boyish in the
soft light of dawn. As he whimpered with cold
and weariness, I could scarcely restrain myself from
easing his head with a motherly touch, but contented
myself with covering him with our blankets.
Breakfast concluded, we prepared to follow our diverging
paths. The soldier wrote a note to a pal at
the military reservation at Cheyenne, commending us
to his care. Then, as we said good-bye, he thrust the
battered canteen into my hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your need is to come, but mine is ended. Keep
it in remembrance of me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He lifted his hat and was gone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dates are a thing of the past along with newspapers,
street cars, electric lights, the hope of a speedy
arrival in California, and last, but not least, our
faithful companion, the stout, green tandem. And
it came about thus:</p>

<p class='c007'>We had reached a country of great level stretches,
with grazing cattle and raw looking farms, of infrequent
water and distant ranges of bare, blue
mountains. Following a barbed wire fence, our road
turned at right angles to the north, whereas the way
should have been open straight into the west where
a more fertile region was blazoned forth in masses
of green and long strips of yellow.</p>

<p class='c007'>We stopped at a rude cabin which crouched,
mouse-like, at the turn in the road, to fill the canteen.
A woman, withered and sunbrowned and worn
by pathetically futile efforts to maintain a home
in an unfriendly land, answered my knock. She
informed us that the fenced range that blocked our
path was part of a great holding to the south, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>projected a long tentacle to enfold a source of life-giving
water far to the north. Thus, we needs must
make a great detour to reach the point to the west
of us where the highway again took up its march
toward the setting sun. This strip, it appeared,
was but a scant three miles in width, and we were
at once filled with the idea of walking across instead
of riding so far around. After some manœuvring,
we succeeded in crowding the wheel beneath the
barbed strands and set off across the prairie, which
was almost as hard and bare as the county road. We
had not gone far when a group of cattle caught
sight of us and moved up to inspect the strange
intruders. These were followed by others, which
seemed a signal to hundreds. Soon a dense mass
was tagging at our heels and spreading out to right
and left, while in the distance still more could be
seen lumbering up to join the herd. A peculiar
prickling sensation began to manifest itself in the
region of my scalp.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear me, I do wish your sweater was blue instead
of red,” I observed nervously to Dan. “I believe
it is making these cattle angry. Do you suppose
they really would attack us?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, of course not. They are perfectly harmless.
They don’t know what to make of us, that’s all, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>their curiosity urges them up to take a good look.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nevertheless, I noticed that he was quickening
his pace. As for myself, I scanned the distance to
the boundary fence with anxious eyes. The cattle,
which at first had maintained a respectful distance,
now began to crowd closer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Please, Dan,” I urged, “take off that sweater and
hide it till we get out of this pasture. I don’t like
the sight of so many cows a little bit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rats, Ethel, don’t be a coward. Who’s afraid
of a few cows?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He turned to wave his hat at the advancing animals,
stepped into a prairie dog burrow and came
heavily to the ground. As he regained his feet, his
features twisted in pain and he caught at the handle
bars.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gee whiz,” he grunted, “I gave my ankle a
beastly wrench. It hurts like the devil.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Visions of dislocations, sprains, of incapacitation
in this God-forsaken spot, flashed before my brain
as I sank to my knees to learn the extent of the
injury, the cattle for a moment forgotten. I unlaced
the shoe, and after a careful examination was
delighted to find that it was nothing worse than a
sprain which would doubtless be well in a few days.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll take the wheel and you sit down while I unpack
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>the emergency kit and get out the bandages,”
I remarked, rising to my feet. “I’ll just put on
a——” The words froze on my lips. We stood in
a ring of cattle less than two hundred feet in diameter.
They stood shoulder to shoulder, heads down,
noses to the ground, blowing, snorting, pawing, while
here and there some young bull would advance a step
with tossing head, then pause while the herd moved
in to join him. Dan broke in on my immobility.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We can’t stop to bother with my ankle now,”
he muttered. “We must make tracks out of here
as fast as the Lord’ll let us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He hobbled on a few steps, leaning on the tandem.
At once the animals in the rear moved forward,
while those in front set up a peculiar moaning bellow,
which seemed to enrage the whole herd. The
air vibrated with their bawling. To my affrighted
eyes the whole plain seemed a solid mass of reddish
backs and tossing heads. Fragments of what I had
read and heard of western cattle came to my mind.
They would attack a man on foot—a person on
horseback was safe——.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get into your saddle, quick,” I cried. “It’s our
only chance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I steadied the bicycle with a firm hand. “Just get
on. I’ll start it.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Dan seated himself and grasped the handle bars,
while with straining muscles I bent desperately to
the task of getting the heavy load in motion. The
tires seemed glued to the rough, uneven surface of
the prairie, and when at last with sobbing breath I
was able to leap into the front saddle, we were
almost on the horns of a heavy animal that blocked
the way. But to hesitate meant death, so with a
blood curdling yell I headed full at his nose. He
crowded aside, I swerved, and we passed between
the rows of cattle with room so scant that we almost
brushed the hairy flanks. I could hear the thunder
of hoofs as the herd got into motion behind us. The
protecting fence seemed very far away. Bushes
slapped at us in passing. The difference between
riding on even a poor road and pedalling over this
unsurfaced plain, level as it was, became increasingly
evident. And how to cross the fence to safety
with a crippled man and a laden wheel, even though
we survived that long, was a problem. The front
wheel struck a sharp, projecting snag and air hissed
from the flattening tire. An instant later the rear
tire also gave way, but we pedalled desperately on,
bumping along on the rims, which each moment
threatened to let us down.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were nearing the western boundary when I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>heard a shout and glancing to the right saw a man on
horseback tearing down the road in our direction.
He began swinging his hat and shooting in the air,
and as the wheel struck the fence, almost throwing
me to the ground, his horse reared to a stop directly
before us. To help Dan through, slip under myself
and drag the wheel to safety was the work of a
moment and I was free to watch the herd as they
swerved away to the south.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gosh all hemlock, that was a close shave,” gasped
the cowboy. “How in Sam Hill did you all get into
such a scrape?”</p>

<p class='c007'>As I started to explain, he noticed that Dan was
lame. He leaped from the saddle and in a trice had
loaded Dan onto the horse. Then, giving me a hand
with the wheel, started briskly in the direction of a
thrifty-looking farm.</p>

<p class='c007'>We halted at last beneath a tree at the edge of
the road. Dan let himself down from his perch, and
upon my firm assurance that we would be all right,
our rescuer resumed his interrupted journey. I kindled
a fire, brought water from a well, then sought
the house, which stood well back from the road, to
secure the loan of a deep bucket. A timid little
woman accommodated me without demur; then followed
curiously into camp. At once I treated Dan’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>ankle with a prolonged hot bath, followed by a careful
massage and the application of arnica-soaked
bandages. The little woman followed every motion
with the keenest interest, and discovering that I was
a doctor, burst into a detailed account of an accident
that had befallen her young son. He had fallen from
a tree and sprained his wrist, which remained somewhat
stiff. Would I be so kind as to examine it and
see what was wrong? This I agreed to do before
leaving, but for the present decided to make camp
for the night, rest, and calm my quivering nerves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next morning Dan was able to get to work on the
wheel, replacing the ruined tires with extras purchased
in Kearney for some such emergency. Again
we rested during the heat of the day, and resolved
to resume the journey next morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tandem was packed for the road when the
farmer’s wife came hurrying out to remind me of
my promise regarding her boy. We entered the farmyard,
which swarmed with hogs of all sizes, and
were led to an enclosed shed where I shut in the
wheel for safe keeping while we entered the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the lad was nowhere to be found. After an
hour of searching, the mother, assisted by an older
brother, dragged the patient, struggling and howling,
from his hiding place in the attic; then held him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>while I discovered a slight displacement of one of
the small bones of the wrist. This I reduced after
considerable trouble, due to the boy’s unruly temper,
and bandaged the arm as the clock struck eleven.
The mother then insisted that we stay to dinner and
as Dan was still rather in need of rest, we accepted
gratefully.</p>

<p class='c007'>The head of the house, a great, burly, red-haired
farmer, came in with the oldest son, a perfect chip
off the old block, and we sat down to a repast of
fried salt pork, fried potatoes, fried onions, hot biscuits
and coffee.</p>

<p class='c007'>The meal concluded, the whole family went out to
see us off. As I rounded the corner of the shed, I
noticed the door which I had latched so carefully,
standing open. Then what a sight met my eyes!</p>

<p class='c007'>The wheel lay flat on the floor, groceries, bedding
and equipment scattered all about, while a shoving,
grunting, struggling mass of hogs rooted, trampled
and fought over it. Chains were broken, tires torn
from the wheels, spokes out, skirt guard bent and
twisted, while through and over all was cocoa, sugar,
coffee, plumbago, clothing, oil and pieces of the repair
kit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Haw, haw,” roared the farmer, delighted with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>the novel sight. “Them hawgs sure have made a
mash on that there bicycle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ya, hah. I fixed ’em, I fixed ’em,” shrieked my
erstwhile patient, jumping about in glee. The little
woman burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan seized a heavy single-tree, which stood in a
corner, and laid about him fiercely, sending the
squealing drove pell-mell from the building. Before
the farmer could stay his hand, he had laid low with
a broken back a fine young boar. A few moments
later a sow showed evidences of internal trouble, was
taken with convulsions, and while we were gathering
up the almost hopeless wreck, laid down and died,
much to the grief of friend farmer, whose mirth was
turned to mourning. Dan declared that the sow had
swallowed his razor and wanted to hold an autopsy
on the remains, but was forced to let the cause of
death stand as acute indigestion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The owner of the hogs cursed bitterly as we started
to drag the poor old wheel back to our little camp,
where Dan spent a day and a half endeavouring to
repair it. But the case was hopeless. The good
green tandem would never take the open road again.</p>

<p class='c007'>The world seemed desolate that night as we sat
beside our dying campfire discussing the situation.
The mournful call of some night bird through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>vast silence waked melancholy echoes in my lonely
heart. The wind, moaning across the barren plains,
spoke of darkness, inchoate, overwhelming. The
stars seemed to stare coldly down upon the whirling
mote to which we poor humans cling so doggedly.
A gleam from a lighted window of the farmhouse
only added to my feeling of isolation. I visioned
the thousands of family groups gathered round the
evening lamps, enjoying the cosy comforts of home,
the sense of peace and security that springs from a
recognised place in society, the feeling of love and
protection, the intimate companionship, and opportunity
for service,—the mother with her sewing, the
father with magazine or paper, the children with
school books or toys—all unwitting, unheeding, uncaring,
utterly indifferent to the fate of the thousands
who roam the highways even as we, having no
place to lay their heads. These, outcast, abandoned,
wretched, are exiles from a land of plenty through
no fault of their own—their only roof, the threatening
vault of heaven, their only couch, the bare cold
ground, their evening lamp some solitary campfire.
Their naked souls shudder in the relentless blast of
endless ostracism.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our little hoard of silver was running low. We
knew by experience that no work was to be had in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>this inhospitable land. Our only hope lay in pressing
forward.</p>

<p class='c007'>Early next morning we cooked a meagre breakfast,
packed such articles as were worth saving into two
bundles, swung these on our shoulders and were off.
We had covered perhaps eight miles and Dan was
beginning to complain of his ankle when in the distance
we sighted a little settlement strung out along
the railroad track. As we approached, I took both
bundles and turned toward the railroad station to
wait while Dan searched for work.</p>

<p class='c007'>As I crossed the right-of-way my attention was
attracted by a man seated on the ground, his back
against a telegraph pole. As I walked past, he
raised his hat and spoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would advise you to stay away from the depot,
madam. The station agent is having a little dispute
with a couple of drunken cowboys. It is scarcely the
place for a lady.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is kind of you to warn me,” I replied. “It
was my intention to wait there for my husband, but
we can scarcely miss one another in this town.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The stranger sprang to his feet. “Permit me to
offer you my telegraph pole,” he exclaimed with a
winning smile. Lifting one of the blanket rolls, he
placed it for a seat, and as I settled myself, sank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>down on the other bundle and entered into conversation.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was a man on the sunny side of forty, tall,
slender, but possessed of evident strength. His
mouth was at once humorous and stern, his nose,
high-arched with sensitive nostrils, gave him a cold,
patrician air, which one forgot when he spoke. Then
white teeth flashed from his sunbrowned face, and
his eyes, of a peculiarly intense reddish-brown, twinkled
roguishly. Never had I listened to a more musical
human voice. With the utmost tact he led me
to tell of our experiences. Soon he was in possession
of the salient features of our journey.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am a sort of Ishmaelite myself,” he declared.
“I take my home with me. I pay no rent, no interest,
no taxes. I do no worrying. I make no plans.
I dream no dreams. I enjoy all in the way of good
living that a human animal can hope for. When
this civilisation is tottering to its fall, I shall be safe
in a mountain resort known to me alone, prepared to
round out my days in peace and comfort.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Too bad that such a nice appearing man should
be so crazy,” I said to myself as he ceased speaking.
As though in answer to my thought he burst out
laughing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I’m not as crazy as I sound. At any rate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>I’m mighty practical about it, as I shall soon demonstrate
to you. My modern prairie schooner, a home
on wheels, will be along presently, and then I hope to
initiate you into a rational method of living in an
insane world. Yonder the caravan approaches.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Following his gaze, I saw a team of mules hitched
to a long, broad, light spring wagon with a black
cover like a heavy automobile top, driven by a large
fair woman, dressed in a yellow duster. Close behind
a young man followed with a team of horses
attached to a smaller wagon or buckboard.</p>

<p class='c007'>My acquaintance stepped to the side of the road
and hailed the woman, who halted at the edge of the
right-of-way. After a brief conversation, she turned
the mules and moved off across the track. The man
turned as Dan approached and introduced himself
at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My name is Adams—Frank Adams,” said he,
“and I have been having a chat with your good
wife. As a consequence, there is a matter of business,
a little proposition that I would like to put
up to you. But this is no place to talk. Besides,
the hour grows late and we must make preparations
for the night. I have directed my outfit to a camping
place in a grove of trees that I located this
morning and I should be very much pleased to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>the two of you come over with me and enjoy a real
open-air dinner. Afterwards we’ll make ourselves
comfortable and go fully into my plan, which I have
every reason to believe will result in pleasure and
financial benefit to us all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan seemed favourably impressed by the stranger’s
frank address. Besides, there was nothing to
hope for in our present situation. So he picked up a
bundle, our friend shouldered the other, and we
were off for the camping ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we entered the clump of trees, my eye was
caught by a small chicken coop with slatted bottom,
which was suspended beneath the rear end of the
wagon bed. Our guide stepped forward and swung
open the door. Three fine young Plymouth Rock
hens, who had been eagerly awaiting this opportunity,
fluttered out and began to peck and scratch vigorously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This simple arrangement insures a few fresh
eggs for emergencies,” Mr. Adams informed me.
“These hens are very tame and are quite accustomed
to this mode of living. Now and then, as to-day,
we get a couple of fryers, and sometimes a nice fat
hen for roasting, which we confine in the rear compartment
until wanted. Thus we are seldom at a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>loss for fresh meat. Just step around to the front
and I’ll show you the cooking arrangements.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the front of the wagon we found the woman
actively engaged in preparations for supper. Our
acquaintance informed her of our situation in a few
crisp sentences and without waiting for a formal introduction
she took up the task of enlightening us in
the art of scientific camping. She directed our attention
to the dashboard which pivoted in the centre
on a horizontal axis to form a support or worktable
that could be used for dining purposes if necessary.
A hood, which telescoped under the front edge of the
wagon cover, could be pushed forward on such occasions,
and by rolling down the curtains, perfect protection
could be secured from wind and rain. As
we gazed, the young man brought a pail of fresh
water and set it in a metal ring which was clamped
to a front upright. The back of the seat was made
in two parts, and to the back of the left-hand one—formed
of sheet metal—a gasoline stove with oven
attachment was fastened. The upright back revolved
in such a way that the stove faced the rear when
the seat was occupied, but could be turned to the
front for cooking purposes. The housewife—camp-wife
would be the better term in this case—could sit
in comfort in the right-hand seat and secure everything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>required from the racks or from the boxes on
the bed of the wagon. With competent hands she
opened the oven door and withdrew a pan of cookies
which flooded the air with a rich, spicy odour. These
she replaced with a pan of biscuits, then produced a
large skillet of broiling chicken from beneath the
spreading burner which heated the oven. A few
deft touches and the savoury pieces went back for
further browning.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I generally make most of my preparations while
travelling,” she informed me. “The mules are so
gentle that they amble along without much driving
and everything is so convenient that I can cook without
stepping from the rig. Even the water is handy.”
She pointed to a heavy canvas bag, beaded with
moisture, which hung on the outside wall.</p>

<p class='c007'>The side walls within were fitted with ingenious
racks like a kitchen cabinet, and a little to the
rear and close against the roof I discerned the wire
springs of a suspended bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” our host explained, in answer to my question.
“The top framework is of metal, made extra
strong with a block and tackle arrangement for
hoisting the bed as soon as it is made each morning.
The mattress and springs were made to order and
are very light. By disposing of it in this fashion we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>gain free access to our stores which, as you see, fill
the bottom of the wagon. The horse feed is in the
rear, our clothing lies in the centre, and the food supplies
occupy the front. We have lived entirely out
of doors, summer and winter, for two years now,
and have suffered practically no inconvenience from
bad weather.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wouldn’t move into a house again for anything,”
his wife exclaimed. “You have no idea what
a pleasant life this is. Housework is reduced to
almost nothing, we get a chance to see the country
and are as free as air.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you find it rather crowded at times?” I
asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no. Every few days we make a regular
camp where we stay for a day or two. Then I get
out the portable oven, make a wood fire, bake bread
and cake, cook meat and vegetables, wash the clothes,
and plan for the next jump.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Our host went to the rear, lifted off the flat top
of a fibre trunk, unfolded a set of legs and set it up
as a table. Then he lifted out the seat from the
second wagon, unloaded three folding camp chairs
and proceeded to set the table with white enamel
dishes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile, the young man, Peter Bates, had come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>in from caring for the livestock, and was introduced.
We all sat down to broiled chicken, boiled potatoes
warmed in gravy, hot biscuits and honey, stewed
fruit, cookies and tea. The food was delicious.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you think of the cooking?” enquired
our host, serving us a second helping of chicken.
“Not many places where you can get meals like
this. We live on the fat of the land the whole year
round, don’t we, honey-drips?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re quite right. That’s just what we do.
And nothing to worry us, either,” responded his wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mine host produced a bottle of port, while Bates
brought out cigars. They greeted our pleasant refusal
to indulge with uplifted brows, and when Dan
passed by the perfectos as well Mr. Adams remarked:
“And not even a cigarette? You are a Puritan, if I
may be pardoned for saying so. Well, maybe we
can do business in spite of handicaps.” He paused
to light a cigar, then lounged back in the wagon seat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m a sort of sublimated pedler. I travel from
town to town selling a couple of styles of window
signs, which our young friend Pete here, puts up for
me. Then, to insure continuous action, I take orders
for a special lamp and for handy tools—combinations,
you know—in the country districts. Thus I
am never out of a job. The lamp orders are filled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>by a mail order house in Chicago, as are the ones
for tools, so that I carry nothing but a sample. The
signs consist of letters which are pasted on the
inner side of the window glass.... You’ve seen
them many times.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Peter wants to quit us and push on to Cheyenne,
and while I am perfectly competent to put up the
orders, I dislike to do so. Why work, when I can
profit from the labour of others? And that is where
you come in. I’ll get the orders and pay you so
much for each sign that you put up. In fact, I’ll
even do better. If you are able to pick up an order
here and there, I’ll sell you the supplies for ten per
cent above cost to me. The work is easy. Any
mechanical man with a true eye can manage with a
little instruction and a day or two of experience.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes,” young Bates broke in, “I’ve always
been a clerk, but I had no difficulty in getting the
hang of this thing. I wanted to go to Cheyenne,
and this gave me a fine chance to see the country
and make a little dough on the side.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A man with your experience and training should
have no trouble at all in making two or three dollars
a day,” the boss continued. “And it should be mostly
velvet. Honey-drips has a little side line of her
own. She carries a few toilet accessories to sell to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>the ladies. In the country districts the housewives
are only too glad to have an opportunity to get such
things in exchange for butter, eggs, poultry, vegetables,
or even bread and canned fruit. We can
always use the stuff some way and it cuts the living
expenses to almost nothing. I get horse feed in
exchange for tools and lamps, and often I can let
the animals graze for a day at a time. Now your
wife can get a supply of these female fixings for ten
per cent above cost and make most of your living.
After you have played the game for a month or
two and find you like it, I’ll fix up that second wagon
like this one here. We use it now for trips off the
main line where we don’t want to take the heavy outfit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s the gist of the plan. Now, how does the
scheme strike you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d be glad enough to get a couple of dollars a
day over our living,” replied Dan. “What do you
think about it, Ethel?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe it would be an excellent thing for the
present, at least. Of course, I won’t be satisfied till
we get back to California, but we should be able to
save money enough to make the trip comfortably in
a few months if we manage carefully.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, so far as getting to California is concerned,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>observed Mr. Adams, “we expect to arrive
there about the middle of next December. We will
work the territory between here and Cheyenne, then
swing down across Colorado, pass through Arizona
in November, and work California in the winter
months. Then if you have not come to love this life,
as I think you will, you can leave us and return to
the old grubby existence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, that will be splendid,” I cried enthusiastically.
“We’ll not only reach home, but we’ll see
the country and save some money for a fresh start—we’ll
need all we can save before we get on our feet
again, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well, then, good people. We’ll consider
the matter settled. You can camp here to-night and
begin to learn the ropes the first thing in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The conversation turned on the day’s work and I
gathered a fair idea of the usual activities. Mr.
Adams would take the light team and with Mr. Bates
push ahead, leaving Mrs. Adams to pursue a leisurely
course with the mules. The men struck the first little
store they came to, or if the country was very sparsely
settled, they stopped at a farm. If they secured a
sign order from the store-keeper, Bates remained to
place it, depending on Mrs. Adams to pick him up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>as she passed. Meanwhile, Mr. Adams drove on to
solicit more orders, search out a suitable camping
place, and otherwise prepare for the coming of his
party. This particular morning Adams had left the
light team with Bates, who was busy with a sign,
and had caught a ride in a passing buggy to the little
town where I had met him. Each day’s programme
was the spontaneous result of immediate needs.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we rose to say good-night, Mrs. Adams produced
milk, eggs and whiskey, and they prepared a
customary night cap. I was startled by the enormous
draught of liquor poured out by our employer,
who, noting my surprise, remarked apologetically,
“I’ve been a frightful sufferer from insomnia for a
number of years. That was one of the reasons which
led me to adopt this mode of living, but even the
open air has failed to relieve me. I’ve tried vigorous
exercise, long walks, hot food and drink on retiring,
medicines—everything—and I’ve found my
only relief in these stiff jolts of whiskey. At times
I am compelled to get up in the night and find the
bottle. But I never become intoxicated.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should think that sort of thing would ruin
your digestion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I take certain precautions. I always take
my evening dram in the form of an eggnog, and if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>I need a drink in the night, I take a large cup of
milk first, which seems to prevent any untoward effects.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We made camp at the far side of the grove and
were up bright and early, ready for the day’s work
with the “California outfit,” as we dubbed the new
caravan. The three men set out with the buckboard,
while Mrs. Adams and I broke camp. After everything
was packed and the mules hitched to the
wagon, my companion got out a few handfuls of
chicken feed and soon had the hens nicely settled
for the day’s journey. Once the mules were in the
main road and headed in the right direction, she
slipped the lines into a patent clutch and began to
unpack her wares.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was glad to find the goods of excellent quality
and reasonable in price. She gave me a few talking
points for each article, told me how much cash I
should demand or about how much I could expect
in trade. Trading, she observed, was an art in itself
and worthy of much study. Stock was replenished
by frequent orders to Chicago, the goods being consigned
to the larger towns along the route. Thus
she would find a fresh supply awaiting her at Sydney,
Nebraska, and would there place an order to be
shipped to Cheyenne, Wyoming.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>I had familiarised myself with the most important
details when we approached a good-sized farmhouse.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come in and watch me work this time, and at the
next place you can try it yourself,” she remarked,
swinging the mules into the driveway.</p>

<p class='c007'>A weary-looking woman opened the door at our
knock and brightened with interest when she learned
of our errand. She led the way to the closely shut
parlour, and flung open the old-fashioned blinds as
Mrs. Adams prepared her goods for inspection. After
long consideration she laid down the case with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d just love to buy some of these things, but I
haven’t a cent in the house. My husband is working
way over in the back lot and anyhow I’d hate to
bother him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, maybe you’d like to trade for what you
want. I would be glad to get some good, smooth
potatoes or nice fresh vegetables if you have any to
spare.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, could I do that?” Her voice was eager as a
child’s. “Come right into the kitchen and see what
you would like.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Inside of half an hour we were back in the wagon
with a fine assortment of vegetables. In fact, it
seemed to me that we had much the best of the bargain.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>In answer to some such observation, Mrs.
Adams chuckled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When I saw how that woman had been trained,
I led her right along. She has no idea of the value
of money or of produce either. How can she, when
her husband never allows her a cent of spending
money? The kind of women who must always beg
for every calico dress and pair of shoes, go wild
when they have a chance to trade for themselves.
You should do as much business as possible with
them—take anything they have—get flour or sugar
if there is nothing else on hand. String ’em along
and you can get a wagon load of groceries for a dollar’s
worth of goods.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Privately registering a determination to do nothing
of the kind, I observed, “I should think their
husbands would find out about that sort of thing
and make trouble.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t worry, we’d be well out of the way before
they could find out anything about the business.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wasn’t thinking about you and me, but about
the farmer’s wife. Seems to me she has troubles
enough without our adding to her burdens.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, you got to learn the first principles of this
business, and the main thing is to look out for number
one. Skin the other woman every chance you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>get. Lots of times they’ll stick you and by minding
your own business, you’ll come out about even in the
end. And you needn’t think there is anything new in
a wife’s selling the groceries out of the house to get
a few nickels to spend for herself. Why, when I
lived in——” She stopped abruptly, then resumed.
“Most grocerymen have cases of women who make
a habit of padding the bills to get a few dollars returned
on the sly. It’s all in the game, and you’ve
got to play your end of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I can’t say I like that kind of a game,” I
declared decidedly. “I hope the day will come soon
when men and women will develop a new psychology
along those lines. The first thing that should be
settled after a couple become engaged is the money
question. They should have a definite understanding
as to how the money is to be spent after marriage,
and the girl should see to it that she never
drifts into a position where she must plead with some
man for what rightfully belongs to her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That sounds very pretty, my dear, but most girls
are glad enough to catch a man without taking
chances by arguing over money matters—they’re too
scared of being old maids.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s mostly the fault of their training or, I
should say, lack of training. So long as they are led
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>to consider marriage the whole end and aim of life,
I suppose they’ll go on getting into situations where
they are compelled to cheat and steal and lie to secure
a few paltry nickels. If I had a daughter, I should
see that she was fully equipped to become a self-supporting,
self-respecting member of society, a
woman who would not look upon marriage as the
only possible solution of life’s problems.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Adams rolled her eyes in horror. “Good
gracious, woman, you talk like one of these here suffragettes.
If I had a girl that talked like that I’d
disown her. Why, you want to break up the home!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If financial independence for women means
breaking up the home, then let it be broken. Poverty
and the economic dependence of woman on man
is the curse of the whole sex relation. It extends
from the society matron who caresses and fawns upon
a husband whom she loathes in order to wheedle him
into the gift of a diamond necklace, a new mansion
or other extravagance, through all the middle class
women who lie and cheat and steal the household
goods to get spending money, on down to the daughters
of the poor who are forced to sell their bodies
in order to exist. We frown upon European marriages,
but expect our own girls to make good
matches, marry for a home, do anything to catch a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>man. Faugh, the thought makes me ill. If we support
the American idea of matrimony, then we must
admit that the only proper basis for marriage is love.
If we are to have free men, we must have free
women who refuse to sell themselves for a home,
social position, or material gain in any form whatsoever.
We must adopt a single standard of morals,
and abolish prostitution, both within and without the
marriage relation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why—why, you—I’m surprised at you,” stuttered
my companion. “I never heard a woman speak
such words before. Such talk is indecent, that’s what
it is, indecent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The truth is often considered indecent, I believe,
especially the naked truth. Like the human body,
it needs to be concealed by a peek-a-boo waist of
prudery and licentiousness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop, stop, not another word.... Such language
is positively shocking&nbsp;... not fit for a decent
woman to listen to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this point in this most shocking conversation,
the mules headed for a wretched two-room shack
that stood a little away from the road. To me the
place appeared too poverty-stricken for hope of business,
but our driver let the mules have their way.</p>

<p class='c007'>A frowsy woman was carrying two heavy pails of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>water from a well near which stood a cesspool, a
ramshackle shed for stock and a great heap of refuse.
The dooryard swarmed with dogs, hogs and children.
A sallow girl, gathering corncobs for the fire, loosed
her loaded petticoat and dashed forward to greet
us. Mrs. Adams seized her sample case and leaving
the mules to their own devices, scrambled from the
wagon. I followed meekly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The farmer’s wife set down her dripping burden,
wiped her hands on her tattered apron and proffered
us a brimming dipper. Thirsty as I was, I felt impelled
to decline—the well’s environment did not
appeal to my taste. No sooner were we within the
house, than Mrs. Adams opened negotiations for a
side of bacon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ve got some extry bacon, but I dunno about
sparin’ none. My old man’s aiming to take some
into town to trade in a day or two and I dunno
what he’d say if I let go of a side.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Maw,” broke in the oldest girl, who had
been examining our display with longing eyes, “never
mind what Paw says. If he trades the side meat,
he’ll just get drunk on the money. He always does.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You shut your mouth and don’t go talking about
your Paw.” The mother gave the girl a sharp slap
on the ear as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>The child’s face crimsoned. “I don’t care. It
ain’t right. We don’t ever do anything but work,
work, work, and Paw, he never works. Then everything
goes for hateful old booze. It ain’t right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, now, Mandy, you orta treat your Paw with
respect. I can’t see what’s getting into the young
ones these days, especially the girls. Mandy here,
bellered her head off cause we let Jeffie, that’s our
oldest, stop last winter with my brother Jed to go
to school. She thought she orta gone too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Jeff’s had two years more in school now than
I’ve had, and still I’m ahead of him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s all the more reason why you orta stay
home and work. Jeffie’s a boy and needs schoolin’,
while you’re a——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re quite right,” Mrs. Adams interrupted; “a
girl don’t need much book learning. She wants to
learn to cook and sew and take good care of her
house so she can make some man a good wife.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, so she can plough and harrow and husk corn
and carry swill to the hogs while her man goes to
town and gets drunk. I hate men. I hate men.”
The girl’s eyes blazed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get out that door, you ungrateful hussy, or I’ll
give you a good lambasting.” The child burst into
tears as her mother pursued her from the untidy living
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>room. “I can’t see what’s got into the child.
She’s always been such a comfort to me—worked
since she was knee high to a duck. Seems like she’s
dead set on going to school, but I can’t spare her.
Why this spring, she and I put in eighty acres of
corn with our own hands, besides milking seven
cows and all the other work. I’ve only got the one
boy; he’s the oldest in the family. I aim he should
have an education, but Jeffie hates school. Mandy
can learn as much in eight weeks scattered through
the winter term as he can in a year, but the spite of
it is she’s only a girl and don’t need schoolin’.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re very wise to keep her with you. A woman’s
place is in the home. Now, don’t you think it
would be a good idea to trade me that bacon? It’ll
make the girl contented to get these things she wants
and she’ll forget all about that fool notion of going
to school. She needs stuff like this to attract the
boys. You make the trade and then figure out some
way of pulling the wool over the old man’s eyes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, maybe I can manage some way. I orta
get something for the poor child, I suppose. Paw’ll
raise Cain, but he does that anyhow. Now, what’ll
you let me have for a good fat side of bacon?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Leaving the two women to conclude the bargain,
I stepped outside and sought Mandy. The poor girl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>seemed only too glad to find a sympathetic soul to
confide in.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was sixteen years old, she said, and although
her opportunities for study had been so limited, she
had managed to keep up with her classes by studying
every spare moment. For the past two years
her teacher had taken a special interest in her and
had advised and helped her in every possible way.
She had a great ambition. It was to become a school
teacher and thus be able to help her mother and
younger sisters.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Toots is past fourteen and strong for her age,”
she concluded, “and May is twelve. They could help
Maw out if I was gone. If I could only have Jeff’s
chance—just have some place to live while I went
to school. But Maw won’t hear of it. I just don’t
know what to do. It’s not for me alone, it’s all the
little ones. Paw gets worse all the time, and Jeff’s
got no ambition. I got to succeed to save the family.”
She squared her wiry little shoulders as though
to support the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sometimes people are willing to take a good,
strong girl and let her earn her board and keep while
she goes to school by working mornings and nights
and holidays. It’s a pretty hard way to live. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>girl must be a servant and never gets any fun. Would
you want to do that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mandy stretched out her browned and calloused
hands. “Do you see those paws? I’ve milked
cows and curried mules and ploughed and suckered
corn, to say nothing of washing dishes and packing
wood and water and such like, all without any hope
at all. Give me a chance to earn an education and
I’ll work these fingers to the bone and be glad to
do it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I can’t promise you anything definite, but
I meet lots of people and I’ll see what I can do. If
I do find a place, how’ll I let you know?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll give you the address of Mrs. Cummings.
That’s where my teacher boarded. You can send a
letter there for me and she’ll see that I get it safely.
Oh, if you’ll only get me a chance!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you sure you have the courage to leave your
home in the face of the opposition of your father
and mother and go away alone to work in some
stranger’s kitchen? You’re under age, too, you
know, and if your parents can find you, they can
force you to return. You’ll have to cut yourself off
from them for two whole years.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I can do it. I swear to you, I will do it—cross
my heart and hope to die. I wouldn’t leave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>my mother, if I didn’t feel sure it’s for her own
good. I can do so much for her when I get to be
a teacher. You’ll try to get me a chance, won’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>I promised to do my best.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Mrs. Adams came out of the door with her
side of bacon, Mandy dashed inside, and returned
in a few moments with a piece of paper which she
slipped into my hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here’s the address,” she whispered. “You won’t
forget, will you? Please, please, don’t forget.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With a few reassuring words I bade her good-bye
and took my place in the wagon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That good-for-nothing hussy of a girl will come
to a bad end, you mark my words,” Mrs. Adams
said spitefully, as I turned to wave my hand to the
plucky little figure standing in the dust of the roadside,
“but I suppose you think she’s real cute, running
down her poor old father.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We jogged along in silence for some time, then,
as we approached a prosperous-looking farm, my
employer suggested that I try my hand at the game.
With sinking heart I dragged my reluctant feet up
the path, but was surprised and reassured by the
warmth of my reception. Unlike the city dweller,
the average country woman rather welcomes the call
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>of a peddler. I was fortunate in more ways than
one, for my customer had money and made a large
selection, so that I was enabled to pay for my goods
and retain sixty-five cents to jingle in my pocket.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the rest of the day, we took turns at the
farmhouses and by night I had quite a supply of
food, which represented clear profit, as I had paid
for the toilet articles in produce. Dan and I had
determined to attend to our own culinary operations
instead of boarding with Mrs. Adams, as had been
suggested. We felt that we could save more money,
and while our table was not elaborate, it satisfied
our needs very nicely.</p>

<p class='c007'>About five o’clock we overtook the men, and following
their direction, soon arrived at the camping
place.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evening meal concluded, Dan and I were sitting
beside our little fire, comparing the day’s experiences,
when Mr. Adams strolled over and threw
himself down beside us. After some desultory conversation,
he plunged into a philosophical discussion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you ever made a study of Nietzsche?” he
demanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve tried to read him, but with little success,”
I replied. “His philosophy is so revolting to me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>that I can scarcely pass an unbiassed judgment on
him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You surprise me. I consider Friedrich Wilhelm
Nietzsche the greatest genius and the most profound
philosopher that the world has yet produced. His
work is so free from sentimental mush, his attitude
is so clearly scientific, he shows none of the weakness
that comes from....”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Frankie, love, come quick. I need you.” It
was the voice of our friend’s fair partner. He rose
slowly to his feet and bade us good-night.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have a hunch that Honey-drips does not care
for philosophy,” observed Dan, as we rose to turn
in for the night.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next few days were uneventful. Mr. Bates
took a train for Cheyenne, leaving Dan to handle the
sign orders alone. We had accumulated an abundant
supply of farm produce of all kinds, in fact, we
were overstocked in some lines, so that Mr. Adams
suggested a change of programme. Instead of riding
behind the mule team, I now go with the men in
the buckboard, and while Mr. Adams solicits sign
orders, and Dan puts them up, I canvass the towns
where my goods sell for cash.</p>

<p class='c007'>The drives seem but half as long as before, thanks
to the superior speed of the horses and the pleasant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>banter of Mr. Adams, who is a most interesting conversationalist.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man is a wonderful study. He often starts
to speak of some personal experience and breaks off
in the middle of the first sentence. He never has
given me the least hint of his earlier life, but I feel
sure that he is a college man. There must be some
mystery in his life. I spoke of my beliefs to Dan.</p>

<p class='c007'>He replied, “The only mystery that I see is that
he is falling in love with you, and that’s not much
of a mystery either. Honey-drips sees how the wind
blows and loves you like a rattlesnake.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I indignantly denied the allegation, for Mr.
Adams’ conduct had been exemplary. But Dan refused
to retract his unjust words, so I determined to
keep my opinions to myself.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had worked a small town a half day’s drive
east of Sydney, where pressing business awaited Mr.
Adams’ immediate attention. Dan had a number
of sign orders to fill and Mrs. Adams some culinary
duties to perform, so it came about that Mr. Adams
and I drove ahead with the buckboard, leaving the
others to finish their tasks and follow.</p>

<p class='c007'>We rose early and began our journey as the rose
and opal tints of dawn were disappearing in the
mounting flood of sunlight. The air was cool and
bracing and the horses cavorted with delight as we
spun past the scattering outposts of the village and
took the white, winding road across the western
plain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Adams set me down at the edge of town and
headed for the express and telegraph office, while I
prepared for peddling. He was out of sight before I
realised that we had not touched the lunch that was
in the buckboard, although it was after one o’clock.
I hadn’t a cent with me, for I had put all the money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>available into an order for special goods, which
Mr. Adams was going to send east. Making change
might prove awkward at first, but I could only do
my best. I selected the most prosperous street and
set resolutely to work.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the first three houses the inmates refused to
open the door, although I could see them peering at
me from within.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing to-day,” exclaimed the fourth housewife
before I could open my mouth.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was growing very thirsty and as I walked up a
flower-bordered path to a vine-covered veranda, I decided
to ask for a drink of water without mentioning
my wares. A sharp-nosed woman answered my ring.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Please, madam, could I trouble you for a drink
of water?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can’t play any of your tricks on me,” she
replied spitefully, slamming the door in my face.</p>

<p class='c007'>As I walked slowly through the yard, I saw a
pleasant-faced young Swedish girl at work on the
back porch of the large house next door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She’ll surely give me a drink,” I said to myself.
She greeted me with a smile as I made known my
wants and in a moment I was quenching the thirst
which had grown unendurable. As I set down the
glass she noted my sample case.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>“You bane sell someting?” she enquired with a
wide smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>With eager hands she fell upon the toilet articles
as I opened the case.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yaw, yaw,” she cried. “I bane want someting
long, long tam. Youst wait. I got money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She disappeared into the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was laying out her selections when a harsh voice
startled me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How dare you sneak into my home and take up
the time of my maids? Leave this house instantly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I whirled around, too amazed to speak. A large,
pompous woman was standing in the inner doorway,
motioning me out with a be-ringed hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But—but madam,” I stammered, “your maid
wants to buy some of these articles. She has gone
to get the money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll not have you cheating my servants. Go
away from here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl appeared at that moment, but her mistress
blocked the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hulda, you stay right where you are. Shame on
you, wasting valuable time on a tricky pedler.
What do you suppose I pay you wages for?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, mam. I ban long tam want....”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That will do. That will do. I don’t want any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>of your saucy talk. You are paid to do the housework,
so get at it.” She turned on me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get off these premises at once. You may be able
to swindle these ignorant foreigners, but you can’t
impose on me. Go now, or I’ll call the constable.
The very idea, crowding yourself right into people’s
homes, talking to their servants, impudent....”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was still raving as I passed out of hearing.
The day was very warm. I was dusty and tired
and hungry. Aimlessly I followed the street till it
terminated in a country road and finally sank down
by the roadside, too weary and disheartened to think
clearly.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was roused by the sound of pattering hoofs and
glancing up, saw a team of grey Indian ponies, attached
to a light buckboard, come scampering around
a curve. They shied sharply at sight of my recumbent
figure, reared and tried to break into a run.
Their driver drew them in with masterly skill, and
circling through the weeds and brush, returned to
learn the cause of the fracas. She was a tall, strong
woman, with an aquiline nose and iron grey hair.
The smile with which she greeted me as I approached
the wagon was very winning.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is there something the matter? Are you ill or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>hurt?” she inquired, leaning toward me with kindling
eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, just tired and a bit blue, I guess. It didn’t
seem worth while to walk any more, so I dropped
right down here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pardon me, but aren’t you a stranger to these
parts? I don’t recall seeing you before. In these
little towns we generally know every one, at least by
sight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I arrived only a couple of hours ago, but I
know this town pretty well already.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She searched my face as though seeking the true
meaning of my words; then her eyes fell on my sample
case, which was still clutched in my left hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you are selling something,” she exclaimed.
“What is it, books?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, not books. And I’m not selling anything
either—not in this town.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, so that’s it. You must have started on
the wrong street. Suppose you jump in with me
and ride out to the house. Maybe it will change
your luck.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I hesitated for a moment, my usual faith in human
nature somewhat shaken by recent experiences.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on, now. Jump in. I’ll bring you back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>to wherever you want to go, whenever you are
ready.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I walked around the wagon and clambered in.
The ponies bounded forward, and away we flew,
winding up among low, rolling hills, until we came
to a small house perched on the side of a knoll.
Care of the team had occupied my companion’s attention
to the exclusion of conversation until we had
entered the house. Then, as she set out a substantial
lunch—afternoon tea, she termed it—we began to
get acquainted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Holiday’s home was in Cheyenne, but her
husband owned this large stock ranch, which led
them to make frequent visits to Sydney.</p>

<p class='c007'>As evening approached, she declared her intention
of driving into town after Dan and keeping the
two of us as long as our business permitted us to
remain in the neighbourhood. Leaving me to devour
a tableful of newspapers and late magazines,
the first I had seen in months, she sped away with
her frisky team and returned with Dan, who had
grown quite accustomed to my peculiar way of making
myself at home in unusual places. As they
drove into the yard, Mr. Holiday rode in from the
range and we all were soon on a most friendly footing.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Mr. Adams had already left a couple of sign orders
with Dan to put up the next morning, but instead
of going into town with him to resume my
interrupted labours as a pedler, I decided to take a
day off to wash and mend our clothing and incidentally
starch my crumpled courage by an interchange
of confidences with my hostess, who possessed a peculiarly
invigorating temperament.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her early years had been full of privations and
severe struggles to gain an education. She had become
a high school teacher, but her health failed,
forcing her to seek the high altitudes of the Rockies.
Here she had met and married Mr. Holiday, a well-to-do
cattle man, and they had built a home in
Cheyenne. One child—a girl—was born to them,
but she had died some two years previously. Since
her death the mother had been almost mad with
loneliness, finding her chief consolation in mothering
the calves and colts and other young creatures
of the range.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was greatly interested in the history of our
experiences, and as I was telling her the story of
Mandy of the corn fields, she suddenly leaned forward
with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give me the address of that Mrs. Cummings. I’m
going back there and if she is half the gritty little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>heroine that you make her out to be, I’ll bring her
home with me and see that she gets the best education
that money can buy. Maybe I’ll take one or
two of the other children, too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But&nbsp;... but maybe their mother will object,”
I faltered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It won’t do her a bit of good if she does,” Mrs.
Holiday replied firmly. “I always get what I go
after. You know, when I saw you beside the road
yesterday, I felt impelled to take you home with
me. I believe in that kind of instinct—intuition—fate—call
it what you will. That little Mandy will
be my girl. I can teach her so much. It will be like
renewing my youth. Of course, she’ll go to school
in Cheyenne, too, and later to college if she likes.
Oh, I’ll get her—rest assured of that. It’s mostly
a question of money, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I handed over the address without another word.
Yes, it would be largely a question of money with
that drunken father and ignorant mother, and it
would be a wonderful opportunity for Mandy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The workings of fate are marvellous to contemplate.
If that old harridan of a woman had not
ordered me from her house, I would not have wandered
out into the country and met Mrs. Holiday.
Then Mandy would not have had her chance. Thus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>the harridan woman is clearly seen to be but an
instrument of a benign Providence. Should she be
censured for an act that results in so much good? I
put the question to my companion, who laughed as
I told her the story.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You were unfortunate in that you began operations
in the fashionable quarter of our fair city. I
know the woman you describe. She is the shining
light of local clubdom, the greatest society leader
here. She would be highly insulted at the idea of
serving as an instrument of Fate. Why, she would
not be the servant of the Almighty himself—if she
can’t boss the job, she won’t play.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It must be rather hard on the maid,” I observed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, she’s notorious for the way she handles
her servants. She gets these green foreigners fresh
from the old country, and keeps them penned in
her kitchen so long as they will endure it. They
are taught to cook and wash and all that, but she
pays next to nothing, and does her best to prevent
their learning decent English or mingling with their
kind. She is a fine person to talk of swindling ignorant
foreigners. A worse exploiter of unfortunate
servant girls it would be difficult to find.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But to-morrow I’ll take you into another part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>of town, over where the human people live, and
probably you will do quite well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was a good prophet, for I have succeeded in
clearing nearly five dollars during the last few days.
It will be with keen regret that I leave my newfound
friend to-morrow morning and take the road
again with the California outfit.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alas, for our dreams of a comfortable journey
home; alas for our expectation of seeing the country;
alas, too, for our hopes of saving money for a
fresh start in the world. We face mountains and
desert with nothing but a grim determination to win
or die.</p>

<p class='c007'>After we left Sydney, Mrs. Adams abandoned
herself to a mounting jealousy, which became increasingly
evident to us all. The hours that I was
forced to spend with her behind the ambling mules,
were torture. She took advantage of every opportunity
to annoy and humiliate me, so that every
atom of my patience and control was needed to avoid
a scene. But my best efforts availed nothing with
the woman. We had been travelling through a
very sparsely settled region some twenty-five or
thirty miles east of Cheyenne when the affair came
to a climax. About eleven o’clock I left Mrs. Adams
waiting in the country road while I called at a
farm house, which stood some distance away in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>clump of trees. She had refused to drive in as usual,
but had ordered me to go in and trade for or purchase
some fresh eggs. When I reached the house
no one was at home, and after considerable search
in the outbuildings, I returned empty handed to the
road, only to find the wagon gone. Dust was rising
in the distance and I could just see the black wagon
top as the mules pulled slowly over a rise.</p>

<p class='c007'>My blood was boiling as I set off down the road
at a jog trot, expecting to overtake the slow-going
mules in the first mile or so. I was within hailing
distance of the team when Mrs. Adams glanced
back, whipped the animals into a lively trot, and
with an insulting gesture coolly outdistanced me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well,” I said to myself, steadying my pace.
“I’ll walk no further than the first water. Then I’ll
rest until night. Dan will come into camp and miss
me. He’ll take the buckboard and start hunting.
And when we finally come up with that woman there
will be something doing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But water is scarce in that country, and at last I
sat down in the sparse shade of a clump of bushes
to wait for a rescue. It came much sooner than I
expected, for it was not more than three o’clock
when I was roused from a light doze by a cheerful
halloo and sprang up to see Mr. Adams reining in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>the horses. He leaped down in a jiffy, brought out
the oozing canvas bag of water that he always carried
in this desert country and handed me a delicious
draught.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get right into the rig, and I’ll unpack your
lunch,” he exclaimed solicitously, assisting me over
the wheel. “I only learned of this infernal outrage
by accident. I landed a rather unusual order this
morning and, leaving your husband on the job to
sketch the preliminaries, drove back to meet the
wagon and rush along the necessary supplies. What
was my surprise to find you missing. My wife and
I had a beautiful row while I was putting up this
lunch and starting back to look for you. She’s gone
ahead now, to take that new lot of letters to your
husband.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had turned the team around as he spoke and
was driving rapidly along the western track. Then
I looked up from my meal in surprise, for he had
swung into a narrow trail leading away to the north.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the idea?” I inquired. “Aren’t you
taking the wrong turning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is a little spring up here a mile or so
where we’ll stop to feed and water the horses.
They’ve been jogging pretty steadily since early this
morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>It was true. The poor beasts were in need of
food and water, and I was glad when we drew up
at a tiny stream, which flowed through the bottom
of a ravine, where we could enjoy the protecting
shade of a few straggling willows. Mr. Adams unharnessed
the sweat-stained animals, allowed them
a swallow or two of water and spread a flake of
baled hay for them to munch until cool enough to
eat their grain. I had settled myself beneath a tree
and had just finished my lunch when he threw himself
down beside me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ethel,” he began, “you are too fine a woman for
the kind of life you are leading. I love you, dear.
Won’t you let me take you away and give you all
the beautiful things that belong to you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>I gazed at him a moment in silence. “Aren’t you
forgetting yourself, Mr. Adams?” I inquired coldly.
“How about your wife?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, that woman. She is not my wife, and she
has no hold on me whatever. Why she was running
an assignation house in Detroit when I picked
her up. Let her go back where she came from.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you can live with a woman for more than
two years, share the burdens of the road, eat at the
same campfire, travel with her as your wife, and
then dismiss her with a wave of the hand? You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>may consider yourself free perhaps, but I am a married
woman and, besides, I love my husband.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You think you love him, no doubt, and maybe
you do—now. But who knows how long that love
will last? You yourself admit that love is the only
legitimate basis for marriage. Your love for your
husband may die to-morrow as the love of thousands
of other women has done. Love is free as the wind,
it comes and goes without reason, without warning,
without restraint.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, I am rich. I flatter myself that I know
the world. I will aid you to a divorce and obtain
one myself. After marriage we will travel, visit
Florence, Naples, drink in all the myriad beauties
of the Old World. If you have ambitions, I will
help you to achieve. I will gratify your tastes for
music, art, literature; I will free those wonderful
impulses that throb beneath that calm exterior—those
sensuous instincts to which your lout of a husband
is so totally oblivious.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I sprang to my feet. “That will be all, if you
please. Don’t say another word.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I busied myself with the horses. He placed their
grain, then drew close to me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My God, Ethel. I love you, girl, love you, do
you hear? Give me just a little chance, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>He caught my hand and pressed it to his lips. I
wrenched it away roughly, and looked about in desperation.
The long shadows of late afternoon lay
among the hills; the country was wild and rugged—not
a human habitation in sight. I was absolutely
alone with this maniac. I turned with resolute
mien.</p>

<p class='c007'>“See here, my friend. If you love me even half
as much as you say you do, you will cease your insulting
proposals, hitch up this team and take me
back to civilisation. You will make me hate you,
if you keep on as you are doing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He stood motionless, staring at me with sombre
eyes. Then, as I began to place the harness on the
horses, he came to my assistance, and together we
watered them and hitched them to the buckboard.</p>

<p class='c007'>We drove home in silence and reached camp just
as Dan came whistling down the road. It was plain
that my husband knew nothing of my desertion by
Mrs. Adams that morning, and I was in no condition
to tell him anything coherent. I stood like a wooden
Indian as he seized me around the waist with a bearlike
hug.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good news,” he cried. “To-day’s work brings
our credit with the old man up to an even fifty dollars.
Not so bad for a poor hobo, is it, now?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>He caught sight of my face and became all sympathy.
“Why, sweetheart, what’s the matter? Are
you sick?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“N-no, not sick exactly,” I faltered, with lips that
persisted in quivering a trifle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you look awfully queer, some way. Has
that old cat been bothering you again?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” I murmured. “She’s pretty mean, and it’s
been so hot, and I—oh, I guess I’m about played
out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He gently led me to a spot as far removed from
the Adams’ camp as possible, made a couple of trips
to the wagons and brought back our bedding, a few
cooking utensils and some food for supper. Then
he induced me to lie down, while he built a fire and
prepared the meal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor little girl,” he murmured. “I know all this
is mighty rough on you, but if I can only keep on
as I’ve been doing for the past three weeks, it won’t
be so very long till we can ride the cushions home
in comfort. Meantime, leave the old cat alone as
much as possible, and try not to take the situation
too seriously.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed that I had scarcely fallen asleep when
I was awakened by a consciousness of something
wrong. The night was dark, but judging from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>stars, it was about midnight. What was it that had
aroused me? I lay still and listened.</p>

<p class='c007'>There came a tinkling of trace chains from the
other side of the big cattle pen where the Adams’
camp lay. Pshaw, it was only one of the mules,
nosing around the camp in search of fruit parings,
as he often did. I lay back reassured and dozed
once more.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again that premonition came; that peculiar instinct
that thrills one into vivid wakefulness in the
midst of quiet slumber. Again I sat up with a start.
Again I heard mysterious noises from the direction
of the other camp. I took my husband by the arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dan, Dan,” I hissed. “Wake up. I hear something.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He grunted, groaned, stretched himself and sat
up. “What’s the matter, Ethel?” he muttered
sleepily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know what it is, but I feel sure there is
something wrong. This is the second time I’ve
waked up feeling this way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Something wrong! What do you mean?
What’s wrong?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s just it. I don’t know what it is, but
there is something the matter at the Adams’ camp.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t hear anything—you must have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>dreaming——Don’t you feel well? I’ll get you a
drink of water.”  He jumped up and searched
around for a cup.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the matter, folks? Did the noise disturb
you?” It was the cheerful voice of Mr. Adams.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Ethel’s got a notion that the bugaboos are
after her,” answered Dan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She heard that mule, I suppose. Jack tried to
get into the grain as usual and got tangled in the
harness. I just finished straightening him out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anything I can do to help you, old man?” Dan
called.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, thank you. Everything is all right now.
Go back to bylo land and never mind if you hear me
fussing around. I’m going to take a high-ball.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Once more we lay down, and this time I slept
soundly. I was awakened by a shout from Dan,
who had risen and dressed without disturbing me.
The sun was well up, but the camping ground was
unaccountably silent. There was no sound of cackling
hens, or of stamping, munching horses and
mules; no smoke rose from the other side of the
cattle pen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ethel, Ethel,” Dan was calling. “Come here,
quick.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>I wrapped a blanket about me and ran to him,
then stopped in consternation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The California outfit was gone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gone also were our odds and ends of equipment,
saved from the wreck of the wheel, my emergency
case, a change of clothing, all the groceries and provisions
that I had worked so hard to accumulate, and
last, but not least, gone were the fifty dollars, left
in Mr. Adams’ hands for safe keeping, over which
we had been rejoicing the night before.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan was stamping about like a madman shouting,
“I’ll kill the —— I’ll get the law on him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He followed the wagon tracks to the main road,
but it was impossible to tell in which direction they
had gone. As he returned, he picked up the old battered
canteen, given me by the ex-soldier as a keepsake,
which had evidently slipped from the wagon
as it jolted over the uneven ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>Together we wandered back to our little camp.
We still had our blankets, a few cooking utensils,
a partly used box of cocoa, a little sugar, part of a
can of sweetened condensed milk, and a few scrappy
remains of the evening meal.</p>

<p class='c007'>After making an unsatisfactory breakfast, we cast
up accounts to determine our line of action. I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>nearly five dollars in silver in a concealed pocket in
my clothing, and Dan had a few dollars also.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were camped near the loading pen of a large
cattle corral placed beside a lonely railroad siding.
We had no means of knowing where Adams had
gone; no way of pursuing him. We had no idea
where to find the sheriff of that county or other officer
of the law. If we should succeed in capturing
the thieves, what sort of a case could we make
against them? We had no written agreement—not
the scratch of a pen to show that they owed us anything
at all. And possession is nine points of the
law. Then, how could we live while waiting for
results from the slow-moving legal machinery? The
case looked hopeless from every angle.</p>

<p class='c007'>I told Dan about Mrs. Adams’ conduct the day
before and something of the affair with the man.
He read me quite a lecture and then advised me to
forget the whole episode as quickly as possible. We
had but one object in life—to reach California as
soon as fate would let us. We must dismiss the
California outfit from our minds—not speak of it
again. But one road lay open to us. We must have
recourse to a “side-door Pullman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bundles on backs, we struck out for a water tank,
there to await the coming of a freight. A long string
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>of coal cars pulled in and stopped for water. Dan’s
request for a ride to Cheyenne was granted with the
proviso that we drop off before we reached the city.
The brakeman spoke to the engineer, who agreed to
take advantage of a steep grade a few miles east of
town to slow down sufficiently for us to jump in
safety, adding that this would be our only chance,
as trains always ran down the further slope into the
city at a high speed. We were forced to ride in a
gondola, which is a fairly warm place in a blazing
sun. Mile after mile we rode, and at last were
warned of the approach to the hill. Crouching at
the end of the car, we waited for the speed to slacken.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly I noticed that the speed was increasing
instead of diminishing, and a glance ahead showed
the engineer waving his arms frantically. The
brakeman bounded into the car.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My God!” he yelled. “The super’s on behind
and Buck daren’t slow down. We’re over the hill.
You’ll be pinched in Cheyenne, sure, and we’ll get
a sixty-day layoff, if we don’t all get the bounce.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We must jump for it, Dan,” I said. “There is
no other way. And we’ll have to be quick about
it, too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Gathering my skirts in one hand, I clung to the
side of the car with the other and leaned far out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>and down. Dan begged me not to try it, but followed
my lead when he saw that I was determined
to go. The earth reeled by at a frightful speed, the
wind lashed my face, the heavy freight lurched from
side to side with crash and roar, gathering momentum
with every turn of the wheels.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a moment my courage failed and I hung motionless.
Then with a violent outward thrust of
hand and arm, I made a sidelong leap. My feet
struck the gravelled path at the side of the rails with
a thud, and catching my stride, I ran clear. Dan
was not so fortunate, but rolled headlong down the
embankment, landing in a clump of brush. In an
instant I reached his side and found him unhurt, but
pale as a ghost from the strain. Together we darted
into the tall bushes and sank down, just as the caboose
swept by, with a man, evidently the superintendent
referred to by the brakeman, standing on the
rear platform beside the conductor.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were still a couple of miles from town, so,
adjusting our packs, we set off down the hot and
dusty road. We had not walked far when a teamster
gave us a lift to our destination.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only possible camping place was beside a
small stream in a group of trees at the south side of
the town. While I made camp Dan went into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>Cheyenne. About dusk he returned, whistling
cheerfully, with the welcome news of a job in the
morning. He had also made a trip to the reservation
and delivered the note sent by our wayside acquaintance
to his friend. This man sent us a little
brown tent, made in two pieces with folding supports
for convenience in carrying. It is called a
“dog tent” by the soldiers and formed a valuable
addition to our equipment. It shelters two persons
comfortably and is so light that I could carry half
besides my usual load without serious inconvenience.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a week now I have had leisure to wash and
mend our clothes and purchase a few necessities for
the coming struggle with deserts and mountains.
Work is too scarce and wages too low to tempt us
to remain here in the hope of accumulating enough
to take us home in proper fashion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan came in last evening quite disturbed over
his failure to collect his wages on the completion of
the work. He worked very cheap for this contractor,
who seems to employ many floaters, and now he
is refused the little money that is due him. He went
uptown this morning, and returned about four
o’clock enraged and disheartened. It seems that his
employer makes a business of hiring men who drift
into town, at as low a wage as possible; then beats
them out of the money altogether, if he can. At
times some unfortunate, whose spirit is not yet
broken, threatens violence, in which case a trip to
jail and a month on the chain-gang curb, if not cure,
his desire for justice. When Dan hinted at reprisals,
legal or otherwise, it was suggested that the
Cheyenne climate was wont to prove unhealthy for
such as he, so it would be well for him to seek new
fields while the going was good. Inasmuch as we
have no standing in this community, besides possessing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>less than three dollars in cash, which would
not go far toward lawyer’s fees or bail money, it
would seem that this advice, bitter as it is, should
be followed.</p>

<p class='c007'>A faint sunset glow illumined the dry, brown
plain as we approached the grade west of Cheyenne.
A pungent odour rose from under foot as we trailed
through the low brush, and as we approached the
track, the rails set up a low humming that steadily
increased in pitch and volume. A glaring eye appeared
in the distance. I had never attempted to
board a train in rapid motion and was more or less
ignorant of ladders, hand holds and other details of
car construction, and the idea of leaping on the roaring
mass that came thundering through the semidarkness
appalled me. Nearer and nearer drew the
engine. The fierce glow of the furnace, as the fireman
laboured to fill the insatiable maw, gleamed red
upon the gravelled track. Black smoke rolled from
the stack and hung low in the quiet air. With
laboured pants, like an exhausted leviathan, the
great machine lurched past.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan caught my hand and we ran beside the track.
Car after car clanked by. The hammering wheels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>seemed hungry for a victim. My eyes visioned the
ghastly death of an unknown man, whose life had
been ground out but a scant half hour before we had
discovered the mangled remains. I saw myself,
hampered with clinging skirts and weighted with a
heavy bundle, clinging, slipping, falling between the
ravening wheels, and a deadly nausea seized me.
With a half stifled cry I turned down the embankment.
Dan pulled and exhorted in vain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s no use,” I said doggedly. “I just can’t
do it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The tail-lights of the caboose faded from view.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’ll be darned,” said Dan. “I never knew
you were a coward.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t care if I am. It’s better than being
chopped to pieces under that train. I feel sure I
should have gone under if I had made the attempt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nonsense,” he replied. “Now we’re in a nice
fix. We can’t stay here. We can’t walk across that
wilderness. And we can’t catch a freight in the
railroad yard on account of Jeff Farr. First time I
ever saw you show the white feather.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just you wait till morning and we’ll see who’ll
show the white feather. I’m going to walk right
into that yard, and Jeff Farr or no Jeff Farr, I’ll
board the first west-bound freight that pulls out.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>Jeff Farr, as all the hoboes know, is an officer,
especially dreaded because of his drastic methods of
handling vagrants, who makes his headquarters at
Cheyenne. We had heard of him repeatedly, for
his fame had spread even beyond Omaha, and his
mere name was sufficient to strike fear in the stoutest
heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a disgruntled mood, we plunged into the
bushes, and without attempting to make camp,
threw ourselves on the ground and slept. At dawn
we ate a cold lunch and turned back toward Cheyenne.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the west entrance of the railroad yard, a watchman
stopped us. I pleaded our cause to such good
effect that he turned his back and gazed into space
as we scurried past. Two long strings of boxcars
stood as though ready for the road, and as we approached,
a brakeman clambered from the top of
the nearest and spoke to me. He had noted the behaviour
of the detective, so as soon as I explained
the situation he motioned to the second string and
told us that it was a west-bound train, already
searched and passed by the detectives, and now waiting,
under the guard of our friend the watchman,
for engine and crew.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ducking across the tracks we examined the long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>line of cars, but each was shut and sealed. In the
middle of the train stood several gondolas, and in
lieu of nothing better, we boarded one. Crouching
down, we waited for the start with every nerve at
high tension. A pair of hands grasped the edge of
the gondola. “Jeff Farr,” thought I with a shudder.
A man’s head appeared above the brim. With
staring eyes, he glared at us for a moment, then,
with an inarticulate grunt, dropped to the ground.
The brakeman who had directed our movements engaged
him in conversation. Another pair of hands
came over the other side of the car. Again a vision
of revolvers, handcuffs, courtroom and jail flashed
through my mind. Again a man’s head appeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’ll be blowed—a woman!” he gasped, and
disappeared from view.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then a third man appeared. He evidently knew
what to expect, for he stared at us with a friendly
grin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The boys said they was a woman up here, but I
thought they was kidding me. Say, you folks got
nerve—sticking your head into the lion’s mouth like
this. Ever hear of Jeff Farr?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’ll take something a whole lot worse than Jeff
Farr to keep me in this God-forsaken hole of a Cheyenne,”
I replied.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>“They said you had grit. Hope you get through
all right,” he answered, as a jolt announced the arrival
of the engine.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Off brakes,” whistled the engineer. With gasps
of relief we saw the buildings glide past, for we
knew we were safe for the present.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the second station out an empty box car was
picked up and the crew transferred us into that.
The strict laws against riding freights caused us to
keep every opening closed. There was no ventilation,
and as the sun climbed higher, we suffered
severely from thirst, for in the excitement of departure
we had neglected to fill the canteen. Shortly
after noon the train stopped and we heard voices
near at hand. The door was shoved open and a
man’s head appeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can’t ride in there. Come out at once.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We leaped to the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Clear out as fast as you know how. I don’t
want to run you in, but if anybody comes along,
I’ll have to, and that may mean a month in jail.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After our Wood River experience, a word was
sufficient to put us in motion, and as we struck off
across the tracks, I glanced back and saw that we
were in the town of Laramie.</p>

<p class='c007'>This little city stands in the midst of a barren
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>plain, ringed about by distant mountain ranges.
Trees are scarce, and what few there are evidently
belong to doting owners, so that it is difficult for
travellers of our persuasion to find shelter from the
broiling sun. On the south side of town a narrow
gauge railroad meanders off across the flat, grey
plain, and near it we found a few discouraged trees
in an abandoned rhubarb field. We made camp,
set up the tent and cooked a much appreciated meal.
As night came on mosquitoes swarmed about and we
had recourse to a great smudge in front of the tent.
About sundown I saw a tall, gaunt man walking
slowly toward an abandoned freight car that stood
on a rusty spur of the dinky railroad. As I watched
his listless movements my professional interest was
aroused, for I took him to be some unfortunate from
the east in search of health.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next morning we went up town, Dan to hunt for
work and I to buy some much-needed provisions.
Dan was lucky enough to secure immediate employment
on some construction work at the Wyoming
State University, located a short distance north of
town.</p>

<p class='c007'>I learned from a neighbour that no use was now
being made of the pie-plant that grew on the railroad
property, so I helped myself to a fine cooking.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>Forced to abstain from fruit and vegetables so long,
the rhubarb made an especial appeal to our palates.
I also discovered a large patch of a wild plant,
which, as a child, I had often gathered for my
mother. She called it “lamb’s quarter,” and held
the young and tender shoots in high esteem for
greens. I now pulled a large panful and we found
them a pleasant addition to our menu. As I worked I
again saw the invalid, and that night the poor fellow
was sitting on a pile of ties with his head in his hands
when Dan came home from work. He looked so
desperately lonely and miserable that I asked Dan
to go over and talk to him and see if there was anything
we could do to help. In a few minutes Dan
came back.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The man is not sick. He’s hungry,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hungry!” I cried. “If that is all that ails him,
he must be starving to look as he does. Go and invite
him here for supper.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan returned with the ragged, pallid stranger,
whose emaciated face was almost covered by a heavy
brown beard. He took a seat on an old stump and
ate what was offered him in silence. After the meal
he filled the water bucket, carried dried dung to replenish
the smudge, then set off toward the boxcar
without a word.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Next morning he sat on the ties as before. Again
Dan called him over, and again he ate in silence, but
on leaving he doffed his scare-crow hat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you very much,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c007'>That evening he appeared without waiting to be
summoned and as he drank his cocoa, I saw Dan
choking with suppressed emotion. No sooner had
the man gone, after attending to the chores as before,
when Dan burst out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you see what that chap did? He picked
up the salt instead of the sugar (we keep both in
cocoa cans) and put a heaping spoonful in his cocoa,
and blessed if he didn’t drink the unspeakable mess
without a quiver.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Next day our peculiar visitor came in rather early
and stood awkwardly about, fumbling with his hat.
Then with a shy, sidelong movement, he laid a fifty
cent piece on our pine box table, and bolted away
like a scared rabbit. A half hour later he came hesitatingly
back, and prompted by Dan’s questions,
explained that he had spent most of the day chopping
wood, for which work he had received the fifty
cents.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had dubbed him Larabo for want of a better
name, as a convenient abbreviation of Laramie
Hobo, and that night he spent the evening beside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>our fire. Emboldened by our acceptance of his pitiful
offering and encouraged by tactful questions, he
told us his story.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was born in Angel’s Camp, California, some
twenty-three years ago, and was one of those unfortunate
children whose father must remain unknown
and whose mother died at his birth, leaving him to
the care of her sisters in shame. The lad grew up
untrained and uneducated, despised by the children
of decent parents; and as he developed into a rugged,
raw-boned youth, took up the work of a gold miner.
He was not lacking in ambition, and saved his
money with some vague idea of escaping the sins of
his parents by migrating to parts unknown and establishing
himself in some business.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the age of twenty-one he had several hundred
dollars in the savings bank, and set out for the east
to better his condition. Farm life attracted him, so
he hired out to a dairy-man. In course of a year he
became very expert and, having saved his wages carefully,
in the fall of 1907 determined to start a dairy
of his own. He rented a small farm, laid in a good
stock of hay and arranged to buy a herd of dairy
cattle. His idea was to make as large an initial
payment as possible, giving his note for the balance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>and depending on cream checks to pay off the indebtedness.</p>

<p class='c007'>The farmer from whom he was purchasing the
cows took him to a money lender to arrange for the
loan. When Larabo came to sign he discovered that
the note ran but six months, and since winter was
coming on with the inevitable drop in cream production
he doubted his ability to meet the note when
due. The banker assured him that the note could
be renewed without trouble, if necessary, and advised
him that this short term note was in his favour,
since it would enable him to pay off some of the
debt in the spring and secure the remainder with a
new note if desired, thus effecting a saving in interest.
Thus persuaded, Larabo signed.</p>

<p class='c007'>All winter long he fed and tended the cattle most
faithfully and they did well, but as he had anticipated,
the receipts from the creamery were insufficient
to meet the note. When he asked for the promised
renewal, the banker declared he could not do it,
the times were too hard, money was scarce, some
banks had issued script. If he failed to pay the
debt, he would be sold out. The green, ignorant boy
did his utmost to raise the necessary cash, but money
was tight, as the banker had said, and a month later
hay, equipment, cattle and savings were swept away.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>Penniless and discouraged, he started to beat his
way to the gold mines of the west. He was brutally
slugged at Cheyenne, and at Laramie was arrested
and given thirty days in jail. On his release he obtained
work as a dishwasher in a restaurant and
there remained until he had saved twenty dollars.
On his way to the station to take a train for the
west he met an officer, who took his money and ran
him in. The judge remembered his face and gave
him a sixty-day sentence.</p>

<p class='c007'>During this period he brooded over his experiences
and on his release sought out the man who had
arrested and robbed him and administered a beating.
He was once more arrested and clubbed and sentenced
as a habitual offender. When his term expired,
the chief of police ordered him to stay away
from the business section of town under penalty of
immediate arrest, and all officers, train crews and
detectives were warned against him. Twice he
walked miles along the western track and caught a
freight, only to be beaten and thrown off. He was
too feeble from abuse and confinement to cross the
mountain wastes on foot, and at last resigned himself
to slow starvation in the rotting freight car.
For five weeks he had averaged but one meal a day,
earned by doing odd jobs around the outskirts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>town, and his wonderful endurance had almost
reached its limit when we took him in.</p>

<p class='c007'>Daily he has come to the camp for breakfast and
supper, and has revealed his gratitude for our attentions
by many little helpful acts and a dumb show
of affection like a faithful dog.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yesterday afternoon dense black clouds blew up
while I was doing some marketing, and before I
could reach camp the most severe hailstorm of my
experience struck the town. I took shelter in the
doorway of a cottage to escape the fearful pelting,
but a woman appeared and sharply bade me be gone.
I then stopped under a cow shed, but a man came
from a near-by house and threatened me with arrest.
Buffeted by the slashing hailstones, I struggled on
to camp, only to find our little tent blown flat and
covered with limbs torn from the trees by the storm.</p>

<p class='c007'>The clouds passed as quickly as they had come.
The sun shone with dazzling brilliance but little
warmth; the sky resumed its wonderful transparent
blue; and in the rarefied atmosphere the distant
mountain peaks loomed clear and sharp with a deceptive
aspect of proximity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Despite the flood of golden sunshine the ground
was still concealed by a liberal coating of hailstones
as night fell.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>I had done all I could to make things endurable
when Dan came in from work, but he thought it best
to sleep in some barn on account of the intense cold.
After seeking permission at four or five houses and
meeting with curt refusals and even threats, we returned
to camp and found Larabo feeding a rousing
fire and busily scraping a spot clear of ice. Here
we set up the tent and spread our thin blankets on
the ground, while a cutting wind swept across the
valley and threatened to tear our shelter from its
fastenings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan’s work was finished, so as soon as we had
thawed out and eaten breakfast this morning he went
to town to get a time table and see if something could
be done for poor Larabo. We have decided to take
a passenger train to the first small station west of
here, so I packed our baggage for the journey while
Larabo looked on disconsolately.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly he whirled about and took to his heels
and, glancing around, I saw a well-dressed man approaching
through the rhubarb field. He came directly
to me and began to talk about the recent storm.
This led to some conversation concerning the University
and I told him that Dan had been working
there. His eyes fell on Larabo, who was moving
restlessly about some hundred yards away.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>“You should not allow that disreputable tramp to
hang around your camp,” the stranger said. “People
complain that you are harbouring hoboes and
criminals, and it is giving you a bad reputation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His words loosed the flood of seething indignation
that had been gathering strength with each succeeding
day. I described the heartless treatment accorded
us by the townspeople; I told the story of
Larabo, and concluded with a scathing arraignment
and denunciation of the Chief of Police who permitted
such outrages. As I paused for breath the
stranger broke in.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I feel sure that the things of which you complain
are mostly due to lack of understanding,” said he.
“Take this Chief of Police now. He is really not
such a bad fellow. His intentions are good. Fact
is, I’m the Chief. Some of our good people have
been complaining and calling this a tramp roost, and
have asked me to have you arrested or run out of
town.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You don’t look like the heartless brute that I
had pictured, and I am glad indeed to meet you,” I
responded, “for now I feel sure that you will take
poor Larabo up town and protect him while he is
earning enough money to get away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With that I invited the Chief to have a seat on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>stump and we talked with mutual benefit and pleasure
until Dan returned. The men were introduced
and Dan explained that he had secured work with
room and board for Larabo with a Socialist family,
who would treat him kindly and vouch for his good
behaviour. All that was necessary was for the Chief
to grant permission for him to remain in town and
furnish protection from official thugs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Larabo was summoned and came reluctantly. I
bade him and the Chief good-bye as Dan went with
them to see our protégé settled in his new quarters.
When Dan gets back we, too, will bid adieu to the
rhubarb field and go our way with a satisfied feeling
of work well done.</p>

<p class='c007'>One more step taken, and a nice long one, too.
We left the passenger train that took us out of
Laramie at the inevitable water tank. The first
freight that passed we made no attempt to board,
for excellent reasons. A number of hoboes were
lounging about, and when this freight pulled in the
crowd separated, some running one way and some
another.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we walked down the siding loud sounds of altercation
arose and a hobo came tearing up the path
with a brakeman swinging a pick handle one short
jump behind. The tramp dodged under the train
and disappeared. A few yards further on another
trainman with a heavy chain in his hands was making
vicious cuts at a slender boy, who dodged nimbly
around and over the cars, now here, now there. It
seemed an inauspicious moment to make the acquaintance
of the train crew, so we returned to the welcome
shade of the water tank.</p>

<p class='c007'>Evening came. We cooked our simple meal and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>prepared for the journey. It was perhaps nine
o’clock when the heavy vibration of the roadbed
announced the coming of another freight. We
crouched in the bushes at the side of the track. The
train jarred to a halt and in the light from the fire
box we could see the hose being let down to the engine
tank.</p>

<p class='c007'>Silently we drew near and made a hurried inspection
of the rolling stock. Only one car was open.
This was a gondola loaded with some massive, black
machinery. We swung our bundles over the edge
and scrambled in ourselves. Pieces of machinery
were heaped in a confused mass, but in one end two
broad, curving bars of metal like huge springs fitted
together in such a way as to form an elliptical enclosure.
Hastily we opened a bundle and extracted
an oilcloth covered blanket. Bundles, hats and canteen
were stowed beneath a projection. Then we
wedged ourselves into the oblong space that scarcely
afforded room for our bodies and tucked the black
covering neatly over us. Hardly were we down
when a “shack,” as the hoboes call the trainmen,
approached over the top of the train and with lantern
in hand leaped from one piece of machinery to
another, narrowly missing our bodies as he passed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan fell asleep almost immediately, but I was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>so fortunate. My head and shoulders rested on a
heavy piece of metal which vibrated and bounded up
and down with the violent jarring of the train.
Crowded as we were in the constricted space, I had
no opportunity to change my position, so could only
submit to the constant pounding with fortitude. At
times it seemed that I could no longer endure the
concussion at the base of the skull, which set up a
violent headache, and also I was in fear that a shift
of the great mass of metal might pin us down and
perhaps crush us. But moving was out of the question,
for the trainmen were constantly passing with
lanterns and pick handles, and woe to the unlucky
hobo who crossed their path.</p>

<p class='c007'>The night wore away, and as the first grey streaks
of dawn showed in the sky the train entered a division
point. Several men engaged in conversation at
the side of the car in which we lay concealed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Got any ’boes aboard this trip, Bill?” inquired
a heavy voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’ve got a suspicion that we may have.
When we stopped for water just this side of Laramie
I thought I saw a couple scooting along the side.
But we haven’t been able to locate anybody. Better
see what you can raise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The next instant a man vaulted onto the end of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>the car and sat on the edge, with feet dangling a
scant twelve inches above my head. Dan was sound
asleep, and I was in deadly fear lest he waken suddenly
and make some move or sound. The intruder
carried a lantern, which shone palely in the growing
light.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, Joe, gimme that lantern a second. I want
to take a look in that refrigerator car.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The seated detective passed the light to his mate,
then leisurely placed his foot within an inch of my
right ear, and stepping over our heads, made his way
across the car. His pal peered into the open ventilator
in the ice chest of the car ahead, and a moment
later both men jumped to the ground to greet the
new crew.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right, boys. No ’boes this morning. She’s
all ready to take out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The engineer sounded the welcome signal and we
entered a new division. It was broad daylight before
I saw a trainman, and then a brakie appeared,
coming over the tops from the rear. With a cautious
motion I pulled the blanket over Dan, who still
slept, and drew a fold across my own face.</p>

<p class='c007'>The brakeman advanced with a cheerful whistle,
and his heel rang sharply on the iron projection at
Dan’s shoulder, who threw out both arms and raised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>up with a cry. As Dan sat up, the brakie sat down
with exceeding swiftness. The two men glared at
one another and it would be difficult to say which
had the blanker expression—Dan, who had been so
rudely startled out of his sound sleep, or the brakeman,
who had witnessed the apparition of a man
rising out of apparently solid metal. The sight of
their gaping mouths and bulging eyes proved too
much for my risibles and stretching out my cramped
arms, I burst into peals of laughter. My unexpected
appearance seemed the one thing needed to complete
the utter mental disorganisation of the unfortunate
trainman. He was too far gone to speak, but gulped
and gasped like a dying fish. Dan and I gradually
eased our stiffened bodies out of our iron cradle, and
by degrees the brakeman’s wits returned. I at once
got to work and soon had his promise to leave us unmolested.</p>

<p class='c007'>But we were not to remain so for long. The conductor
himself came over the top—a new thing in
our experience—and kindly, but firmly, told us to get
off at the next stop.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus we found ourselves in the edge of a fair-sized
railroad yard, the name of which we made no
attempt to learn, but contented ourselves with seeking
a quiet spot where we could cook a meal and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>rest. The back of my head, neck and shoulders was
bruised black from the hours of pommelling, and I
was glad to snatch a few hours of restless sleep.
Dan prepared and packed a box of food, filled the
canteen and made ready for the night’s adventures.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just at dark we entered the railroad yard as a
freight rolled in from the east. Dan told me to wait
while he reconnoitred. Hardly had he gone when
a man appeared at my side as though he had risen
out of the ground. He held a pocket flash in one
hand and a club in the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you doing here?” he demanded sternly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waiting for my husband,” I said.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lifting the flash, he examined me from head to
foot. Reaching forward, he tapped the box of lunch
under my arm with his billy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What have you got in that box?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Grub,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So ho! A box of grub and a roll of blankets.
You look like a woman hobo.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I admitted the charge and declared my intention
of taking the west-bound freight. “And I suppose
you are a detective hired to prevent that very thing,”
I concluded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ve struck it,” he answered. “That’s....”</p>

<p class='c007'>He leaned forward and stiffened like a pointer dog
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>in the presence of a flock of quail. With wonderful
dexterity he slipped the flash in his pocket and drew
a revolver, then moved forward with the sinuous
grace of a panther and as silently as a shadow. I
heard the footsteps of several men approaching
across the yard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Halt!” barked the detective. “Throw up your
hands. Keep ’em high now, and face the east. Now,
beat it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I heard the sound of running feet, punctuated by
dull thuds as the detective belaboured the heads and
shoulders of the fleeing men with his billy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fo Gawd’s sake, don’t, Boss. Oh, Gawd.
You’re killin’ me.” It was the pleading voice of a
negro, who seemed to be bearing the brunt of the
clubbing.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a few minutes the detective came back, panting.
My blood was boiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You great big brute, you,” I began. “Why don’t
you jump somebody who has a decent chance, if you
must act like a devil?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ve got your nerve, young lady, talking to
me like that. Don’t you know I can run you and
your old man in if I want to?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I suppose you could. But what makes you
want to be so cruel? You don’t look like a brute.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>“Well, maybe I am too rough, though that is what
I’m hired to be. Besides, some yeggs broke into a
building in a little town up the line about a year
ago, and when me and my mate tried to run them in,
they shot my pal dead and winged me in the shoulder.
Since then I club all hoboes on general principles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Just then I recognised Dan’s step as he came up
the yard. The detective made a forward movement,
but I seized him by the arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s my husband coming, and you better let
him alone. If you start clubbing him, I’ll fix you,
pistol or no pistol.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let go. I’ll not hurt him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He bounded forward, and intercepting Dan, questioned
him closely. Then ordering him to remain
where he was, he returned and questioned me. Then
he summoned Dan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, people,” he said, as Dan came up. “I
guess I’ll take a chance on you. If the conductor
don’t get wise and make a kick, I’ll not see you when
you get aboard that cattle car yonder. So long.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hurrying over, we climbed in just as the train
pulled out. As I peered through the slats in the
front of the car, I saw a hobo make a running leap
into the gondola immediately in front of us. A soft
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>footfall sounded on the roof of our car and the detective
leaped down beside the hobo, who scrambled
madly up the end of the boxcar ahead. The men
reached the roof almost together and for a moment
seemed etched against the sky. The officer made a
mighty swing with his billy at the tramp’s head.
There was a crack like a revolver shot, and the hobo
pitched from the top of the rapidly moving car and
rolled head over heels down the twenty foot embankment.
Sickened, I clung to the bars while the
train rushed on.</p>

<p class='c007'>The floor of the car was covered with filth, so that
sitting or reclining was out of the question. To add
to our discomfort a storm blew up and the cold wind
and rain beat between the slats and chilled us to the
bone. As we slowed at a siding a low, mournful
sound came to our ears, and we found ourselves beside
a great cattle train. The poor animals moaned
and bellowed in the sleety blast. Some were down,
and I could easily picture their experiences of long
hours without food and water, exposure to the broiling
heat of the noonday sun in the crowded cars,
followed by the night’s cold wind and rain.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were completely exhausted when morning
came, and crawled weakly out when a brakeman
ordered us off the train. Throwing ourselves in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>shade of boxcars that stood on a lonely siding, we
were instantly asleep. The sound of voices wakened
me and, sitting up, I saw a dozen hoboes scattered
about. Some were east and some west-bound,
but all agreed that this particular division was the
deuce to cross.</p>

<p class='c007'>A freight rolled in and some boarded her, but did
not linger long. With shouts and curses, the train
crew plied pick handles and chains, and every man
was beaten off.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some two hours later another freight hove in sight
and we concealed ourselves in the high brush beside
the track. The crew united to drive the crowd of
hoboes down the line, and as the chase swept past,
we hastened to examine the unguarded cars. In the
middle of the train stood three cattle cars loaded
with ninety-pound steel rails. These were piled in
sloping tiers on each side, leaving a runway down
the centre of the car.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here’s a good place, Dan. We’ll lie down in
there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good heavens, girl,” he cried aghast. “If those
heavy rails should shift in swinging around these
mountain curves, there wouldn’t be enough of us
left to hold a funeral over.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m not particular about my funeral, if it should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>come to that. I’d rather trust the rails than the detectives.
Come on, I’m going in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Opening the end door, I piled in and lay down in
the little runway. On either side the sloping heaps
of rails rose high above my head. Dan closed the
door and lay down also.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trainmen were too busy with the hoboes to
disturb us, or they considered the rail cars too dangerous
for the most daring adventurer, for we were
left in peace.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rails grated and chafed as we rocked along.
I took a look at Dan, who grew a trifle white about
the lips when the rails shifted a little. I was full of
content as I realised that we were making good
progress, and laid my head on the bundle and slept.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was night and Dan was shaking me and whispering
in my ear when I wakened. Staggering up,
I gazed about, bewildered. Taking my hand, Dan
led me out of the car, which stood on a siding, and
across the tracks away from the lighted street of a
town.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is an awfully tough town,” he said softly.
“The rail cars were cut out here, and I went for
fresh water. I never saw so much drunkenness or
so many toughs in my life. We must get away before
morning if we possibly can.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>A distant whistle announced the approach of an
engine. A long train of tank cars clanked to a standstill.
We advanced hopefully, but not a car was
open. The yard was dark and we chose a tank car
close behind the engine. A narrow ledge projected
in front, and on this we perched—feet dangling and
backs close pressed against the end of the great cylinder.
The engineer and brakeman sauntered up and
paused close by. The brakie carried a lantern in one
hand and rested the other not two feet from my side.
There they stood and talked while we almost ceased
breathing. But the deep shadow of the tank concealed
us, and they separated, leaving us undiscovered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then began the wildest ride of my career. That
engineer seemed speeding to the bedside of a dying
friend, or perchance, to some sweetheart who awaited
his coming. The crest of the mountain range was
past and the train shot like a meteor round shouldering
hills and through the steep ravines. The tank
car leaped and plunged like a thing of life, threatening
to leave the rails at each sharp turn of the
road. Balancing perilously, we clung like limpets
to the narrow shelf, while a wild thrill, born of the
rapid motion through the mountain fastnesses with
the night wind fanning my face, drove all fear from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>my mind. I could have shouted with pure delight
and felt that I need only will it and my soul would
part company with all material things to soar to
meet the stars that blazed overhead.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first flush of dawn brightened the sky as the
lights of a good sized town appeared ahead. We
gathered ourselves up for the leap. The train slowed
and entered a long railroad yard. A group of men,
lanterns in hand, stood at one side of the track, and
as they caught sight of us, they set up a shout and
raced for the train. A dozen cars swept past before
they were able to board it, and we saw them moving
forward around the awkward tank cars. A single
glance identified them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll have to jump quick before the brutes get
any nearer,” I cried.</p>

<p class='c007'>The train was still moving at a lively clip as we
leaped off. Catching our stride, we raced for the
sagebrush on the right. The officers set up another
racket, but apparently considered a chase hopeless.</p>

<p class='c007'>Circling widely, we came to a squat building on
the outskirts of town. From within rose a hum of
machinery and in the doorway stood the stalwart
figure of a young man. He hailed us merrily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello, there! Where are you going in such a
hurry?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>We explained our plight, and he was good enough
to come to our aid.</p>

<p class='c007'>We entered the power plant and watched the
youth fetch out water, soap and towels for our convenience.
Catching sight of myself in a mirror, I
uttered a cry of surprise. Coated with dust as I was
from the long ride so close to the engine, I more
nearly resembled a negress than a white woman.
While we removed the stains of travel, the boy
placed coffee pot and frying pan on a small stove in
a corner and soon spread a savoury meal on the pine
table. While we ate, he explained that he had the
night shift at the plant and slept in the building
during the day. He had a reputation for feeding
every hobo who came along. Consequently, the
officers might come there to look for us. Besides,
the day man was not so charitable, so it would be
well for us to be out of sight before he arrived.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leading the way to his little cubby hole of a room,
he pulled the bed out from the wall so that it stood
almost across the doorway, and spread some quilts
on the floor behind it. Tossing our bundles out of
sight, he suggested that we lie down and remain as
quiet as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were scarcely hidden when the day man arrived.
Our friend complained of a sick headache
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>and said he had moved his bed to get more fresh air.
He had darkened the room as much as possible and
now threw himself down and feigned sleep. Three
men approached the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, Frank,” one began, “a couple of hoboes
came up this way and we want ’em. You better
come across now and tell us where they went. We’re
getting tired of the way you run a tramp roost up
here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you’ve got your nerve, I must say. Can’t
a fellow get any rest from you fee-chasing scavengers?
Here I go to bed with a sick headache, and no
sooner do I fall asleep than you come chasing hoboes
and wake me up again. If you want any information,
why in hell don’t you talk to Harry? Ask
him if he’s seen any tramps.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sorry if you’re sick, old man,” answered one of
the officers soothingly. “We didn’t mean to disturb
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cut the bunk,” growled another. “I want to
know if you saw these bums?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I haven’t seen any bums,” shouted Frank
savagely. “Furthermore, I want you pussy-footed
bulls to clear out of here. I’m sick, and I want to
sleep.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He whirled over with his back to the door. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>officers stood about uncertainly for a few minutes
and then we heard them tramping about the building.
When all was quiet, Frank thrust his head
over the edge of the bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How was that for a stiff bluff?” he chuckled.
“Your uncle Ezra is right there with the goods, ain’t
he, what? See any bums? No, of course not. The
only bums I ever see are those bulls that hang around
the station. And now that the fly cops have flitted,
tell us the sad story of your young lives.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So I took up the familiar tale and the lad listened
with bated breath and sparkling eyes while I led him
step by step across the country. On conclusion he
told me of himself. He was a student in a technical
school, utilising his vacation to gain practical experience
in his specialty of electricity and earn
money for the coming term.</p>

<p class='c007'>As I lay prone on the floor, the intense pain of my
bruised spine eased a trifle, and lulled by the hum of
the generators, I fell asleep. Night had fallen when
I awoke and both men were gone. I found them
chatting busily, while Dan repacked our bundles
for the journey and Frank broiled a large steak over
the coals.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fill up, sweet friends, fill up,” quoth he, carving
a huge slab of meat. “Ways are long, the steak is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>fleeting, and the jail is not your goal. At least, we
hope that it doesn’t prove to be. So eat and be
merry, for to-morrow you may be in Granger.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing loath, we fell to with great gusto, and
while we ate, discussed the best method of getting
out of town. We decided to take a passenger to the
first stop, as at Laramie.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we started to the train, our host seized his hat
and made ready to accompany us.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll just let the buzzers look after themselves
while I give you the benefit of my powerful protection
up town. Those bulls won’t be so liable to run
you in because you’re walking the streets without
a thousand dollars in your pockets if I am by to
testify to your noble characters. Then I know most
of the boys who run out of here and I may be able to
fix it so the freight crew will pick you up without
any trouble.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus we bought our tickets and said good-bye to
our young friend while the officers glowered from a
distance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once more we got out at a barren flag station, but
we hadn’t long to wait. As the freight stopped, a
brakeman leaped down and came directly to us.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right, folks, we’ll give you a lift and pass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>you over the next division if we can. Get in that
boxcar over there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In we crawled and rode in comfort the night
through. Early next morning, as the train sped
through a desolate wilderness, another brakeman
climbed into the car.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you do?” he began. “We heard about
you from the boys back there, and we’ll see you as
close to Ogden as we can. But you’ll have to leave
this car, as it’ll be dropped next stop, and the only
place for you is in an empty fruit car way up near
the head of the train. You’ll have to go over the
top while she’s spinning. Do you think you can
make it?” looking at me anxiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure,” I answered boldly, my tone implying that
I had walked the tops of moving freights since the
age of three.</p>

<p class='c007'>Strapping our bundles to our backs, we started.
I confess to a peculiar sensation in the pit of my
stomach as I trod the narrow plank nailed along the
apex of the roofs, and jumped from car to car, while
the train rocked heavily along, lurching around the
curves, and the wild landscape rotated past on either
side. But after the first few minutes the feeling
passed and I was able to conclude the journey with
all the sang-froid of an old hand.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>“After to-day, I’ll be expecting to meet women
brakies most any time. You’d make a swell member
of the Union,” volunteered our guide, as we settled
ourselves in the fruit car.</p>

<p class='c007'>The day passed and the night. About four in the
morning another brakeman appeared and roused us.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will stop at Uintah about sunrise,” he said.
“You will have to go back to the rear of the train,
and be ready to drop off as the train slows down for
the station. Get away as quickly as you can, for if
you are discovered riding on this train, the whole
bunch of us may spend a month in jail.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So I took another stroll along the swaying roofs
and climbed onto the rear platform of the caboose.
As the train began slowing for Uintah, we flipped
off and bolted away from the track.</p>

<p class='c007'>After many miles of wilderness the fertile valley
looked very beautiful to our tired eyes. Accustomed
from childhood to an abundance of fresh fruit the
year round, the restricted diet of recent months has
told on me. Now berry vines, fruit orchards and
vineyards reminded me of home, and we determined
to buy a little fruit, fresh from the garden.</p>

<p class='c007'>Passing up a tree-bordered roadway, we came
upon a long, low farmhouse, squatted at ease upon
a terraced hillside, the brown of its unpainted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>wooden frame blending with the russet hues of tree
trunks and knotted loops of trailing grape vines. A
fluffy maltese kitten with arching back scampered
with sidelong leaps to meet us, then frolicked up a
tree. Two dogs set up a racket and a winsome, dark-eyed
girl came to the door. I asked for ten cents
worth of raspberries. With a charming smile she
led the way to the roomy kitchen, and taking down
a bright tin pail, placed it in my hands with instructions
to go right into the patch and help ourselves to
what we wanted. We busied ourselves among the
tall, green canes, and as the scent of flowers and
fruit came to my nostrils, it seemed that I had been
transported to the beautiful spot where I was born.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At last I can realise that I am nearing home,”
said I, turning to Dan.</p>

<p class='c007'>On our return to the kitchen with the luscious red
berries, the laughing maid met us, and set out dishes,
spoons, sugar and a great pitcher of yellow cream.
And what a feast we had! Our hostess informed us
that the first passenger train that stopped at their
little station did not come through till nearly one
o’clock, so while Dan roamed about the ranch, the
little woman and I sat on the long veranda and got
acquainted.</p>

<p class='c007'>With shy head hanging and many a blush, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>said she had been married but four months. Her
husband, who was a Mormon, was then at one of his
other ranches, where he stopped for weeks at a time.
I surmised that she was not his first wife, but warned
by her attitude, forbore to question. She told me of
her limited opportunities and narrow horizon. With
wistful eyes she listened to my descriptions of large
cities. She herself had never been further than Ogden,
and only twice to that metropolis. The furnishings
of the house were crude in the extreme, and
she confided to me her longing for curtains such as
she had once seen in Ogden, and hoped to have a
strip of carpet for the parlour floor some time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly she flung herself on her knees at my side
and buried her face in my lap, while great sobs
shook the slender body. She was all alone she said,
all, all alone, and she was afraid. Her mother had
eleven children and was always too overworked to
listen to her daughter’s nonsense, as she called it.
I gently raised the child—she was but sixteen years
of age—to my lap, and with tender words and petting
calmed the storm of sobs. When she could
listen I advised her as best I could, and wrote a set
of instructions to guide her in the coming hours of
need. Poor little wild rose. I dread to think of
what the future holds for her, so sensitive, so frail.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>Once more we took a train and soon landed in
Ogden. Turning to the left, we crossed the river
and came to a large cottonwood grove. Here we
pitched camp and Dan took up the never-ending
search for work. Last night he came home with a
big watermelon and the welcome news that he was
to start work on Monday morning. So for a few
days at least I am free to rest and sew.</p>

<p class='c007'>Well, little book, my entries are almost finished,
for the business of building a new niche in the world
with nothing but our bare hands will leave scant
time for keeping a diary.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan had several days’ work in Ogden. Then we
took a passenger to the first stop west as usual and
there boarded a freight. We had not gone far when
a trainman thrust his head into the car in which we
were riding, and failing to see me huddled in a corner,
accosted Dan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello, Jack. What are you riding on?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A union card,” replied Dan, following the accepted
formula, and pulling the card from his pocket
for inspection.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what else?” queried the brakeman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A dollar,” said Dan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not enough, Jacko. It’s two dollars or nothing
on this division. Cough up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So Dan gave him the two dollars and the train
moved out.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>On the edge of the Great Salt Lake the freight
stopped again and another brakeman leaped into the
car. He gaped in amazement at sight of me, then
turned to Dan, “You’ll have to come through, old
sport. This kind of baggage is worth a five spot.
Come across now, or you’ll have to swim the lake.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, Dan,” I broke in sharply, as he hesitated.
“Don’t you give those petty grafters another penny.
Let’s get out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The trainman turned on us threateningly, but one
good look sufficed, so we were left undisturbed beside
the track. We had heard more than once of
trainmen who not only took money from hoboes,
but also relieved them of Ingersoll, knife, or any
little trinket they happened to have about them, but
this was our first experience with the breed.</p>

<p class='c007'>With our bundles for pillows we slept through
the night, and awakened at dawn when another
freight stopped for a last drink before crossing the
lake. We piled into a gondola just as the train
gathered speed and felt that we would at least cross
the lake in safety. We had not gone a mile when a
trainman leaped in beside us.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you riding on, friends?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A union card,” said Dan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what else?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>“Not another blamed thing,” Dan answered determinedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, that don’t listen very good to me,” the
fellow growled. “Where did you come from and
where are you going?”</p>

<p class='c007'>While we gave him a sketch of our experiences
and reasons for riding freights, he drew a stub of a
pencil from his pocket and began scrawling on the
back of a time table.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Loan me your knife a minute, old man,” he said
to Dan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan passed over the knife, a very fine one that I
had given him the first Christmas after our marriage,
and the brakeman sharpened his pencil.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, so long,” said he, turning on his heel, and
starting to slip Dan’s knife into his pocket.</p>

<p class='c007'>I seized his arm like a flash and wrested the knife
from his hand before he could recover from the unexpected
assault.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, you don’t. Oh, no you don’t,” I hissed furiously.
“That’s my knife and I propose to keep it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, you little hell-cat, you.” He burst into a
laugh. “I didn’t mean to steal your knife. Gee,
she’s some scrapper,” turning to Dan. “Wouldn’t
mind having a pal like that myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>With another laugh he made his way to the rear
of the train.</p>

<p class='c007'>A half hour had passed when we were amazed to
see him coming over the top with a coffee pot in one
hand and a pan in the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thought maybe you might be hungry,” he said
with an embarrassed laugh, as he set the pan of
boiled meat and doughnuts on the bottom of the
car. As he bolted toward the head of the train, we
attacked the food with ravenous appetites.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were so engaged when a man leaped from the
boxcar behind, landing in the gondola with a clatter.
I looked up into the amazed face of the conductor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good Lord!” he ejaculated. “Well, good Lord,
so this is what old Tight-wad was up to. What have
you done to him anyhow? Hypnotised him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you talking about?” asked Dan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, that front brakeman of mine. He’s the
meanest cuss on this division, bar none. He’ll hold
up a ’bo and pry the gold out of his teeth. I noticed
him skirmishing around in the caboose a while back,
and he acted so blamed mysterious that I had to
come up front and see what in blazes he was up to.
Well, I’ll be jim swiggled if ever I expected to see
old Tight-wad pulling any charitable stunts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The conductor proceeded to ply us with the usual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>questions, which we answered to his entire satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s an empty refrigerator car up ahead,” he
declared, “that is billed straight through to Sacto.
She’s locked all right, but the ventilator in one of
the ice chests is sealed open, and you can slide in
there and lie snug till you land in Sacramento.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Swallowing the last drops of coffee, we followed
him over the tops to the fruit car. Sure enough, the
little door that covered the hatch at the end of the
car stood open, the support bound with the lead
seal, which must never be broken except by the
proper officials.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gathering my skirts closely about my ankles, I
slid into the opening feet first, and catching the
edges with my hands, swung inside the ice chest and
let go. Dan followed, and we found ourselves in
peculiar surroundings. The floor of the cubby-hole
was formed of scantlings laid on their edges, with
wide interstices for drainage. There was scarcely
room to move and the only light entered the little
opening high above our heads. As I gazed upward,
I felt caught in a trap. We curled down on the
grating and resigned ourselves to fate.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the sun climbed the sky the heat increased, and
it was then that we noticed that our canteen was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>empty. Nobody came near. We dared not show
ourselves. So the day passed in great discomfort.
Night fell and we slept fitfully. Morning came and
again the sun blazed down on the desert wastes and
the tortures of thirst became intense.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had been twenty-four hours without food or
water when Dan decided to risk a reconnoitre. Taking
the canteen, he swung himself up to the hatch
and thrust out his head and shoulders. A brakeman
came on the run. After considerable parley he took
the canteen and promised to fetch us water at the
first stop. But the afternoon wore away and he
failed to appear. We were almost insane from thirst
and heat when at last he lowered the dripping canteen
into our prison.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Winnemucca the car was shunted back and
forth for an hour, but at nightfall we were off on
the long climb to the summit. I climbed hand over
hand to the hatchway, and after a cautious survey
of the surroundings, drew myself out and perched
on the roof of the car. The Overland Limited shot
past, the roof covered with the crouching forms of
hoboes, thick as barnacles on an old pier. The desolate
expanse of desert seemed full of mystery, as the
long train, dotted here and there with lanterns,
crawled like a gigantic snake up the steep grade.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>Far ahead two engines coughed and laboured, the
black smoke rolling in great billows from their
stacks. As I realised that we were nearing the
boundary of California a great contentment filled
my soul. Thus I revelled in thoughts of home, while
the cool night wind fanned my face and the Big
Dipper swung across the northern sky and the speeding
wheels clanked a cheerful refrain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Early next morning the brakeman made us a visit
and said we would be in Sparks before noon, where
we must make another change.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just outside the city limits we dropped off, and
as guests of the trainmen were soon eating our first
restaurant meal for months. About two o’clock we
wandered to the outskirts of town, for it was useless
to attempt to catch a freight in daylight. We came
to an irrigating ditch lined with a tall growth of
weeds, and slipping off our footgear, were soon paddling
about like a couple of kids in the swift running
water. Late in the day we cooked and ate a meal,
took a farewell wash in the stream and returned to
the railroad yard. Word had gone forth not to molest
us, so we boarded the night freight without
difficulty. The only available place was a cattle car
loaded high with lumber. The end door was unlocked
and there was quite a space between the piles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>of boards and the roof of the car. I settled myself
in a corner with back against the siding, and Dan
lay at my feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was pitch dark when the train clanked through
the streets of Reno. As we drew slowly out of town,
dim forms appeared, and hoboes began piling into
the car through both doors. In the darkness I could
sense the presence of a large number of men. Two
lads curled down at my right, their voices proclaiming
their youthfulness. On the left two hoboes lay
so close that I could have touched them. They had
come from a long ride on a limited passenger and
were completely exhausted. A group of men in the
far end of the car began smoking, and as each match
flared, some face would stand out in bold relief.
They talked with perfect comradeship, and though
they were totally unaware of the presence of a
woman, there was little to complain of in their conversation.
In fact, I can truthfully say that I heard
more profane language in one year’s attendance at
Medical College than on this entire trip.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the first stop out of Reno still more men came
aboard. A trainman came to the far door with a
lantern, but one look sufficed and he returned no
more. At Truckee the car was switched to a siding.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>“Beat it, boys, here come the bulls!” shouted a
hobo.</p>

<p class='c007'>Like dry peas out of a pod, the hoboes scattered
out of that car and fled in all directions as officers
flung open the door at our side and emptied their
revolvers into the interior. We remained motionless
as the bullets thudded into the wood, and in a
few minutes looked out to see the detectives chasing
the fleeing hoboes across the yards.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now is our chance,” whispered Dan. “Make
for the round-house yonder.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We dived within the yawning portal and crouched
within the engine pit. The place seemed empty and
we sat in silence for a time. What to do we did not
know. It was impossible to remain where we were
for long; discovery meant a trip to jail and a month
on the chain-gang for Dan. The town lies in a
mountain fastness with snowsheds protecting the
tracks, so that foot travel was out of the question,
and our money was almost gone. While we studied
the problem, a long freight came through without
stopping. We ran out to the main track and the
first thing that caught my eye was the familiar old
refrigerator car with the open hatch in which we
had already ridden so many miles.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>“Quick, quick!” I cried. “We must catch that
train.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The engine had cleared the yard and was gathering
headway with each turn of the wheels. Racing
madly beside the track, I made a desperate lunge
and caught a hand rod. My arms seemed torn from
their sockets as my body was snapped into a horizontal
position by the speeding train. A moment I
clung, unable to move, then with a fierce scramble,
I found my footing and clambered to the top of the
car. Dan had landed on the car behind and together
we started for the head of the train.</p>

<p class='c007'>A brakeman appeared on the top of a boxcar. At
sight of a woman coolly parading the roof of the
freight, his jaw dropped and he started so violently
as to make me fear for his safety. We stopped on a
flat car and gave him a brief explanation, then hurried
forward and swung ourselves into the familiar
ice chest, for we were nearing the snowsheds.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trainman soon joined us. He told a long
story about some division official who was death on
hoboes, and who made a practice of travelling up
and down the line and pouncing on the train crews
at unexpected places in hope of catching them in
some infraction of the rules, which would enable
him to indulge in his love of discipline. This martinet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>took a special delight in harrying the men, and
would suspend an employé for sixty days on the
smallest pretext, or deprive a man of his credits for
the slightest infraction of some unimportant rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s a Company pet, who was born with the big
head and then bitten by the efficiency bug,” our companion
concluded, “and if he should catch a woman
on this freight it would be as much as all our jobs
are worth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At that moment a man thrust his head into the
manhole and called the brakeman out. He ascended
quickly and his place was taken by the other, who
proved to be the conductor. Dan started to speak,
but was interrupted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let the woman talk. I’ll get the truth from
her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So I began the old, old story, and after a bit secured
permission to ride as close to Sacramento as
we dared. We were well outside the snowsheds
when the conductor left us, and I settled down with
the thought that the worst was over.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the train pulled out of a station the light was
cut off abruptly and a young man in a business suit
bounced into the ice chest. As he landed, I looked
up and caught sight of the horrified face of the
brakeman leaning over the manhole.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>“Who put you in here? How much did you pay
that brakeman to let you ride?” he demanded
fiercely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, we haven’t paid anybody—we haven’t
seen any brakeman. We just got in when the train
slowed up back there a ways; and we took good care
not to see any brakeman or let any brakeman see
us,” I answered innocently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But what are you doing here, and where are you
going?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, we came up from Sacramento for a little
camping trip. My husband thought he could get a
little work in the mountains, but he couldn’t find
any, and we spent most of our money, and then
started to walk home. This old freight came crawling
along, and there wasn’t anybody on the far side
of the track, so just for a lark we slipped in here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So, you’re sure your husband didn’t pay the
brakeman for the chance, are you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You bet I am. Do you suppose anybody would
pay good money for riding in this old hole? Besides,
we haven’t any money. I couldn’t see anything
wrong about riding, exactly. But, of course,
we didn’t want the trainmen to see us. I was afraid
they might not like it, and I’m dead sure nobody
but you knows we’re here.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>The brakeman’s face appeared for an instant in
the manhole above, then disappeared from view.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re not going to put us off, way out here, are
you?” I asked pleadingly. “It’s awful hard to walk
clear down to Sacramento this hot weather, and
carry these heavy bundles. It didn’t cost the railroad
company anything for us to ride here. We
ain’t doing any harm.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The young man’s face softened a trifle and he
launched into a long dissertation on the evils of
jumping trains, the hobo menace, and kindred topics,
to all of which I listened with wide eyes and bated
breath. The train drew into a station and out
again, while he was thus absorbed, and he made no
move to put us off. I was drawing him on with deft
questions and flattering attention when the brakeman’s
head appeared once more.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What in blazes is all this?” he bawled. “Hey,
you bums, come out of there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Our kind instructor cast a startled look aloft.
“Why, hello, Condon,” he called ingratiatingly.
“You are on the job, I see. But these people don’t
happen to be bums. Everything is all right. I’ll
assume the responsibility, so just trot along and
leave us alone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He resumed his pompous attitude and took up the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>delightful task of enlightening me on the importance
of his position, which he declared was extremely difficult
to fill. I gathered that the destinies of the
entire railroad system rested on his narrow shoulders;
that he was the original efficiency expert; and
that all other employés of the Company, from train
boy to superintendent, were a lot of mutts, if not
worse, and were it not for his constant supervision
and stern discipline, the division would just naturally
go to the bow-wows. The miles slipped by as
I drank in this information with greedy ears. His
chest expanded like a pouter pigeon and his hat
band seemed to stretch visibly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The three of us were standing in one end of the
restricted space when once more the daylight was
cut off and the conductor slid down beside us. Completely
ignoring our existence he turned a cold and
hostile eye upon our companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sir,” he began stiffly, “I have been informed by
a member of my crew that a high official of this
division has taken it upon himself not alone to disregard
the strict rules of this company regarding the
carrying of passengers on freight trains, but has
arrogated to himself the control and management of
those directly responsible to me. Such a situation is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>unprecedented, sir, and I hereby make formal protest
against its continuance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>While he was speaking I saw the shadow of a man
pass the opening overhead.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, my dear man,” stammered the “high official,”
wholly taken aback. “How can you make
such statements? I had absolutely no intention—no
such intentions at all. How can you make such
a charge?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The facts, sir, speak for themselves. My brakeman
discovers his superior closeted in the ice chest
of a refrigerator car with a young woman and an
unknown man. When he endeavours to exercise that
authority with which he is vested by the rules of
this company and requests the said young woman
and unknown man to leave the train at once, you,
my dear sir, impose the force of your superior station,
and taking all responsibility upon yourself order
him to ‘trot along.’ I claim that such conduct destroys
efficiency and is fatal to discipline.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Our young entertainer seemed at a loss for a
reply; then he plunged into a long explanation of
our presence and his intentions regarding us. The
conductor listened with an air of undiminished coldness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well, sir,” he said shortly, at the close of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>the harangue. “Your conduct is, of course, highly
irregular, but I shall make no report of it—at least
not at present,” fixing the unfortunate “high official”
with a piercing glance. “As to your er—guests, I
shall leave the matter of their disposition entirely
in your hands, since you have assumed the responsibility.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The conductor swung himself out of the ice box
while the young man turned his harassed gaze upon
us.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You better get off at Auburn,” he said weakly.
“Climb out as soon as the train stops, so nobody will
see you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he clambered slowly out, the general impression
was that of a man about three sizes smaller
than the one who had entered.</p>

<p class='c007'>We left the car the instant the train stopped at
Auburn, but as we hastened away we were hailed
with loud shouts by the train crew, who followed
us on the run, headed by the brakeman. We stopped
behind a row of boxcars as they joined us. With
whoops and howls they slapped one another on the
back, danced about, doubled up and fairly rolled on
the ground in convulsions of laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, didn’t our old man hand that fellow some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>chunks of language? Say now; didn’t he?” gasped
the brakeman when he could speak.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He passed it out like a regular dictionary. Just
the same kind of dope that Little Tom-tit has been
feeding us on so long,” sputtered the fireman, who
it seems had left the engine on the way down to join
the gleeful circle about the manhole while the circus
was going on within.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I guess I punctured his tire, all right,”
vouchsafed the conductor. “Guess he’ll go a little
easy on efficiency and discipline with this crew for
a while.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wouldn’t have missed that performance for five
hundred dollars,” broke in the rear brakeman. “It
was the richest thing I ever heard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You should have heard Miss Innocence here
stringing him along when he first came aboard. Her
eyes kept a-glowing bigger and bigger, and his chest
kept a-swelling and a-swelling, till I thought I’d
bust. Oh, he was a wonderful man, all right, all
right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, boys,” remarked the conductor, whipping
off his cap. “You all admit you enjoyed a good
show, that would have had a very different ending
if it hadn’t been for the quick wit of this gritty lady.
Chip in now, and pay for your reserved seats.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Money rattled into the cap and despite our protestations
the conductor forced it into Dan’s hands.
With quip and jest the men bade us good-bye, and
we passed over to the main street in search of a restaurant.
Our hunger appeased, we marched boldly
to the station and took a passenger train to Sacramento,
where we made connection with the river
boat for San Francisco.</p>

<p class='c007'>So now I sit on the deck of the steamer and watch
the green and fertile country glide past. From time
to time a signal flutters on the bank, the boat swings
over and the crew rapidly loads great boxes of plums,
luscious peaches, early pears, and crates of seedless
grapes. Here comes a man with a truckload of magnificent
Burbank plums. I once read of the little
plum with the enormous pit, from which the California
wizard evolved this beautiful fruit. He did not
attempt to change the nature of the plum to that
of some transcendental fruit. He simply modified
the environment so that the inherent qualities of the
plum might develop. Would that the environment
of the little children of the slums and sweat shops,
to whom the meanest cull that lies in yonder orchard
would be a gracious treat, might be so modified as
to give their essentially beautiful, natural qualities
an opportunity for healthy, normal growth.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>I give a sigh of contentment and happiness as I
realise that the hazardous journey is ended. And
now I realise another fact. For weeks I have been
free from colds or cough; my digestion is superior to
that of an ostrich; a ten-mile jaunt with twenty
pounds of baggage on my back would be mere child’s
play. A more healthy human specimen than myself
it would be hard to find, so I feel free to dismiss
the spectre of tuberculosis along with the other horrors
of the slums.</p>

<p class='c007'>But physical benefit is not the greatest gain. A
change has taken place in my psychology. My belief
in the inherent kindliness and unselfishness of
the human heart has been strengthened. In cases of
cruelty I recognise an outside influence or pressure
that warps natural instincts. Toward the trainmen
especially I am deeply grateful. When one realises
the risks they ran to aid a couple of outcasts, and the
kindness and consideration so often manifested, a
wonderful appreciation of their sterling manhood is
born. Never again will I think it necessary to
change human nature before we can improve social
conditions. I am conscious of a deeper human sympathy;
a wider vision; a greater understanding of the
problems of the under dog and a closer sense of fellowship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>with him. I feel that I am learning the
divine lesson of human unity, which is rooted in the
Fatherhood of God and manifests itself as the Brotherhood
of Man.</p>

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org
